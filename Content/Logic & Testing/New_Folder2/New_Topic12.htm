        <p>Golden Tate says Seattle’s offer was “laughable”</p>

        <p>Before the start of free agency, wide receiver Golden Tate said he would 
 consider giving the Seattle Seahawks a “hometown discount” to remain with 
 the world champions.</p>
        <p>“I would rather take a little less to be happy and win ball games than 
 to take way more and go to a crappy city where the fans don’t give a crap 
 about the team,” Tate said at the time.</p>
        <p>Instead of re-signing with the Seahawks, Tate accepted a five-year, 
 $31 million to join the Detroit Lions on the second day of free agency.</p>
        <p>Tate was willing to take a slight discount to stay in Seattle, but he 
 says he wasn’t offered a slight discount.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t mean a 40 percent discount,” Tate said in an interview on 
 710 ESPN Seattle, via Terry Blount of ESPN.com. “I’m going to earn in 
 one year at Detroit what Seattle was going to pay me for two years. Seattle 
 offered numbers that were laughable. I thought, ‘I’ve given you everything 
 and this is what you give me?’</p>
        <p>“Considering I was there for four years, and started two of those years. 
 I missed one game in those two years. I did everything right and wasn’t 
 a trouble maker. And what they offered, I was like, ‘Is this serious?’ 
 The numbers [the Seahawks] shot at me were not first-priority, like they 
 said they wanted to do for me to stay in Seattle.”</p>
        <p>With new contracts on the horizon for safety Earl Thomas, cornerback 
 Richard Sherman and quarterback Russell Wilson, the Seahawks don’t have 
 the ability to be big spenders this offseason. They’ve proved that by 
 only signing one outside free agent so far in receiver Taylor Price in 
 the first week of free agency. It also appears to be reflected in the 
 size of the offer they extended to Tate.</p>
        <p>Tate said he still thinks highly of the Seahawks’ organization and head 
 coach Pete Carroll, but ultimately he had to do what was in his best interest.</p>
        <p>“It’s a business and I get it,” Tate said. “But I felt I was undervalued 
 a little bit considering all I had done. I’m going to miss the city of 
 Seattle, but I really had no choice. I did my very best to stay in Seattle. 
 I leave with my head high.”</p>
