        <p>The NFL's halftime shows are generally attempts at serious entertainment 
 that devolve into absurdity, so it's perfectly fitting that the NFL is 
 attempting a serious lawsuit that is, in truth, absolutely ridiculous.</p>
        <p>More than two years ago, during Madonna's halftime performance, Sri 
 Lankan rapper M.I.A. offered up a brief middle finger during her performance. 
 In order to protect your delicate sensibilities, we've blocked the offending 
 digit with a headshot of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>
        <p>If you think you can handle a half-second view of a single upraised 
 digit, however, steel your heart and watch the video below:</p>
        <p>Whoa. WHOA. That was like saying "We're No. 1," but WITH A 
 DIFFERENT FINGER. You can see the problem there, right? Right ... ?</p>
        <p>The NFL sure did, attempting to fine M.I.A. $1.5 million for alleged 
 breach of contract and alleged tarnishing of the NFL's reputation. Now, 
 according to the Hollywood Reporter, the league is taking a new and peculiar 
 tactic, attempting to fine M.I.A. another $15.5 million for "restitution" 
 of the "exposure" she was given during her performance.</p>
        <p>How did the NFL arrive at such a figure? By taking into account the 
 fact that the halftime show was watched by approximately 167 million people, 
 and multiplying M.I.A.'s two-minute appearance by the approximate value 
 of the time commercial sponsors paid to advertise on the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Such a claim would be patently ridiculous on its face: seriously, who 
 in America had their life measurably worsened in any way by seeing a brief 
 glance of an action they could observe a hundred times a day in traffic?</p>
        <p>Plus, as M.I.A.'s attorneys note, the NFL isn't exactly swimming in 
 credibility on this issue. In court filings, they note, in exhaustive 
 detail, the "profane, bawdy, lascivious, demeaning and/or unacceptable 
 behavior by its players, team owners, coaching and management personnel 
 and by performers chosen and endorsed by NFL to perform in its halftime 
 shows."</p>
        <p>M.I.A.'s attorneys pointed to Michael Jackson's "genitalia adjustments" 
 in his 1993 Super Bowl halftime show, and Prince's use of a silhouette 
 to make his guitar look like an "erect oversized phallus" in 
 2007. Plus, they noted the NFL's own idea to penalize the use of the N-word 
 with a 15-yard penalty as an example of differing punishment. Finally, 
 they contended that NBC failed in its duty to televise the show on a five-second 
 delay.</p>
        <p>Court filings contend that the "continued pursuit of this proceeding 
 is transparently an exercise by the NFL intended solely to bully and make 
 an example of Respondents for daring to challenge NFL."</p>
        <p>The NFL has many serious issues threatening the integrity of its game: 
 concussion concerns, locker room atmosphere, off-field criminal activity, 
 game-day experiences, city-versus-team financial wrangling, and so much 
 more. On that list, M.I.A.'s middle finger ranks somewhere below finding 
 a new executive shoe-polish supplier.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the NFL has the right to protect the integrity of its product, 
 and the halftime show is probably the most valuable space of entertainment 
 real estate in American culture. But the pettiness and hypocrisy of this 
 approach undercut the NFL's stated goal of brand protection. If the NFL 
 is truly interested in preserving its image, it'll drop this farce of 
 a case and forget it ever happened.</p>
