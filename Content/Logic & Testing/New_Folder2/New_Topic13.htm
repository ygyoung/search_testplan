        <p>Courtney Love Claims She May Have Found Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, 
 Shares Picture</p>
        <p>Did Courtney Love crack the case? The 49-year-old singer claimed on 
 Twitter Monday, March 17 that she may have found Malaysia Airlines flight 
 370. </p>
        <p>"I'm no expert but up close this does look like a plane and an 
 oil slick . . . prayers go out to the families #MH370," Love wrote, 
 with a link to crowd-sourcing service Tomnod.</p>

        <p>She also posed a photo of her evidence, with a diagram of where she 
 believes the plane to be. "Really? look closer? check it out @DR24 
 #MH370 and its like a mile away Pulau Perak, where they "last" 
 tracked it," she captioned her photo analysis. Click here to see

        <p>Love told New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer that she found the 
 location herself. "Yeah I went to the satellite site and just uploaded 
 tons and tons of pictures," she explained. "I really doubt aliens 
 took it. It's got to be somewhere. I'm a little obsessive."</p>
        <p>The rocker said she wanted to do her part to help locate the flight, 
 which vanished on March 8, in order to help the families of the 239 passengers.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="search" />"I saw an article asked people to help search on Tomnod.com so 
 I decided to give it a shot," she told Daily Intelligencer. "I 
 figured a plane would still be leaking some fuel so I searched for signs 
 of an oil slick. I found one and there appeared to be an object nearby. 
 I don't know if it is the plane or not, but I figured I'd do my part and 
 bring some awareness to the site, for the sake of all the families involved."</p>

        <p>Tomnod, however, previously ruled out Love's possible location of the 
 plane, saying, "Although it is still an interesting clue, it is looking 
 much more like the other boats operating in the region."</p>
