        <p>Couple returns from trip to discover their fully paid house has been 
 mistakenly foreclosed</p>

        <p>Mel and Harriet (last names withheld) from Coconut Creek, Florida returned 
 home after a trip up to New York and saw something alarming – their locks 
 hadbeen changed, the power had been turned off, and items were missing. 
 It turns out someone had broken into their house. But it wasn’t any common 
 thief, as WPLG Local 10 News reports.</p>
        <p>No random burglar had sneaked in - it was a bank via the company SafeGuard 
 Properties. SafeGuard Properties, based in Ohio, is a business that, “inspects 
 and maintains defaulted and foreclosed properties for mortgage servicers, 
 lenders, and other financial institutions.” They arrived at Mel and Harriet’s 
 home to take it back, believing it was in default. As it turned it out, 
 it wasn’t in default. As Mel told WPLG, “We haven’t had a mortgage in 
 15 years.” So how did it happen? SafeGuard went to the wrong address.</p>
        <p>Mel and Harriet (WPLG)</p>
        <p>Attorney Scott Sobol described SafeGuard’s actions as “legalized burglary,” 
 and that “It should have been evident to that company that this was not 
 an abandoned property.” Mel and Harriet their house smells musty because 
 of the power being off, but that they’re mostly embarrassed at the thought 
 of their neighbors thinking their home would be foreclosed after never 
 having missed a bill in their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>(WPLG)</p>
        <p>WPLG got a statement from SafeGuard:</p>
        <p>"Safeguard has acknowledged the error and has been working with 
 the homeowner to resolve it. Errors such as this are rare, and we are 
 sorry when they occur."</p>
        <p>SafeGuard has a lot of scrutiny these days, as The Huffington Post has 
 reported, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan brought a case against 
 the company late last year. It’s part of what The Huffington Post describes 
 as part of a “wave of unflattering media coverage” of the foreclosure 
 industry. SafeGuard, along with other smaller companies are being accused 
 of unlawfully breaking into homes.</p>
