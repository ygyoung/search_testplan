        <p>A college student from Winnetka, Illinois jumped into a cab for a short 
 ride to a restaurant in downtown Chicago, but instead of a couple dollars, 
 she was charged almost $800.</p>
        <p>In December, 20-year-old Becky Siegel was running late to meet friends 
 at the Sweetwater Tavern and Grille, so she went immediately from the 
 Metra train to a cab at the Ogilvie Transportation Center.</p>

        <p>Becky Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The restaurant was less than two miles from the station and Becky’s 
 mother, Susan Siegel, told WFLD Fox 32 News, "He was apparently very 
 friendly and chatty, and was talking about pedestrians crossing where 
 they shouldn't." Once she arrived at her destination, the student 
 asked the cab driver if she could use her credit card for the fare. “He 
 gave her a price and she thinks it was, you know, under ten dollars,” 
 explained Susan. “And so she said, ‘Can I use a credit card?’ And he said, 
 ‘Oh, my swiper isn't working. Here give it to me and I'll do it on my 
 Square."</p>
        <p>The Square mobile payment device (AP Photo/Russel A. Daniels)</p>
        <p>The Square device and app allow merchants to charge customers through 
 a mobile device. Becky handed over her credit card, told the driver to 
 add a $2 tip, and signed the app. Becky told the Chicago Tribune, "I 
 guess I didn't pay attention or I didn't look…I just signed my name with 
 my finger and I left."</p>
        <p>Susan Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The problem was, as Susan Siegel found out while reviewing her transactions, 
 instead of a charge under $12, the card was charged a whopping $787.33. 
 Ms. Siegel contacted Visa customer service to dispute the charge, but 
 because Becky had signed off on the transaction, a refund was refused. 
 The Chicago Police department told Siegel that there was nothing they 
 could do about it either. Angry about what transpired, Siegel contacted 
 the driver, Ali Ghazanfari, for a resolution. Instead the cab driver stood 
 behind the nearly $800 charge. </p>
        <p>(WFLD)</p>
        <p>Ghazanfari’s tune changed when Siegel got in touch with the Chicago 
 Tribune’s, “What’s Your Problem?” problem solvers. They reached out to 
 the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. "I 
 remember exactly what happened,” the driver told the Tribune. I made a 
 mistake on the fare." Ms. Siegel said, "He called me two or 
 three times, and he was in a panic. What I do know is that he is really 
 sorry that he got caught." </p>
        <p>Ghazanfari said he made efforts to contact Square and his bank to refund 
 the Siegels’ money but because the company had only the last four digits 
 of their credit card, that was not possible. Another request to Visa by 
 Ghazanfari and Siegel working together, was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Mika Stambaugh (WFLD)</p>
        <p>Mika Stambaugh, a spokesperson for the Department of Business Affairs 
 and Consumer Protection, said that they contacted Square and the company 
 promised to send Siegel a check for $787.33 by the end of this week. Stambaugh 
 added, "Our department has suspended his public chauffeur license 
 pending this investigation… He cooperated with us but he's not in the 
 country so we still have a few unresolved issues pertaining to this case.”</p>
        <p>So how can you avoid incidents like this from happening to you? Ms. 
 Stambaugh explained that, "The problem here was that Square is a 
 non an approved device. So we want to urge people to use the front and 
 back mounted credit card device payment systems in our cabs and that's 
 it." She also said that passengers should never allow their credit 
 card to leave their hands and if it does, to contact 3-1-1. Finally, a 
 lesson that Becky Siegel learned the hard way, always double check the 
 final charges before signing a credit card receipt.</p>

 promised to send Siegel a check for $787.33 by the end of this week. Stambaugh

 Stambaugh explained that, "The problem here was that Square is a

 back mounted credit card device payment systems in our cabs and that's 
 it." She also said that passengers should never allow their credit 
 card to leave their hands and if it does, to contact 3-1-1. Finally, a

        <p>A college student from Winnetka, Illinois jumped into a cab for a short 
 ride to a restaurant in downtown Chicago, but instead of a couple dollars, 
 she was charged almost $800.</p>
        <p>In December, 20-year-old Becky Siegel was running late to meet friends 
 at the Sweetwater Tavern and Grille, so she went immediately from the 
 Metra train to a cab at the Ogilvie Transportation Center.</p>

        <p>Becky Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The restaurant was less than two miles from the station and Becky’s 
 mother, Susan Siegel, told WFLD Fox 32 News, "He was apparently very 
 friendly and chatty, and was talking about pedestrians crossing where 
 they shouldn't." Once she arrived at her destination, the student 
 asked the cab driver if she could use her credit card for the fare. “He 
 gave her a price and she thinks it was, you know, under ten dollars,” 
 explained Susan. “And so she said, ‘Can I use a credit card?’ And he said, 
 ‘Oh, my swiper isn't working. Here give it to me and I'll do it on my 
 Square."</p>

        <p>The Square device and app allow merchants to charge customers through 
 a mobile device. Becky handed over her credit card, told the driver to 
 add a $2 tip, and signed the app. Becky told the Chicago Tribune, "I 
 guess I didn't pay attention or I didn't look…I just signed my name with 
 my finger and I left."</p>
        <p>Susan Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The problem was, as Susan Siegel found out while reviewing her transactions, 
 instead of a charge under $12, the card was charged a whopping $787.33. 
 Ms. Siegel contacted Visa customer service to dispute the charge, but 
 because Becky had signed off on the transaction, a refund was refused. 
 The Chicago Police department told Siegel that there was nothing they 
 could do about it either. Angry about what transpired, Siegel contacted 
 the driver, Ali Ghazanfari, for a resolution. Instead the cab driver stood 
 behind the nearly $800 charge. </p>

 ‘Oh, my swiper isn't working. Here give it to me and I'll do it on my 
 Square."</p>

        <p>The Square device and app allow merchants to charge customers through 
 a mobile device. Becky handed over her credit card, told the driver to 
 add a $2 tip, and signed the app. Becky told the Chicago Tribune, "I 
 guess I didn't pay attention or I didn't look…I just signed my name with 
 my finger and I left."</p>
        <p>Susan Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The problem was, as Susan Siegel found out while reviewing her transactions, 
 instead of a charge under $12, the card was charged a whopping $787.33. 
 Ms. Siegel contacted Visa customer service to dispute the charge, but 
 because Becky had signed off on the transaction, a refund was refused. 
 The Chicago Police department told Siegel that there was nothing they 
 could do about it either. Angry about what transpired, Siegel contacted 
 the driver, Ali Ghazanfari, for a resolution. Instead the cab driver stood 
 behind the nearly $800 charge. </p>
        <p>(WFLD)</p>
        <p>Ghazanfari’s tune changed when Siegel got in touch with the Chicago 
 Tribune’s, “What’s Your Problem?” problem solvers. They reached out to 
 the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. "I 
 remember exactly what happened,” the driver told the Tribune. I made a 
 mistake on the fare." Ms. Siegel said, "He called me two or 
 three times, and he was in a panic. What I do know is that he is really 
 sorry that he got caught." </p>
        <p>Ghazanfari said he made efforts to contact Square and his bank to refund 
 the Siegels’ money but because the company had only the last four digits 
 of their credit card, that was not possible. Another request to Visa by 
 Ghazanfari and Siegel working together, was unsuccessful.</p>

        <p>Mika Stambaugh, a spokesperson for the Department of Business Affairs 
 and Consumer Protection, said that they contacted Square and the company 
 promised to send Siegel a check for $787.33 by the end of this week. Stambaugh 
 added, "Our department has suspended his public chauffeur license 
 pending this investigation… He cooperated with us but he's not in the 
 country so we still have a few unresolved issues pertaining to this case.”</p>
        <p>So how can you avoid incidents like this from happening to you? Ms. 
 Stambaugh explained that, "The problem here was that Square is a 
 non an approved device. So we want to urge people to use the front and 
 back mounted credit card device payment systems in our cabs and that's 
 it." She also said that passengers should never allow their credit 
 card to leave their hands and if it does, to contact 3-1-1. Finally, a 
 lesson that Becky Siegel learned the hard way, always double check the 
 final charges before signing a credit card receipt.</p>

        <p>A college student from Winnetka, Illinois jumped into a cab for a short 
 ride to a restaurant in downtown Chicago, but instead of a couple dollars, 
 she was charged almost $800.</p>
        <p>In December, 20-year-old Becky Siegel was running late to meet friends 
 at the Sweetwater Tavern and Grille, so she went immediately from the 
 Metra train to a cab at the Ogilvie Transportation Center.</p>

        <p>Becky Siegel (WFLD)</p>
        <p>The restaurant was less than two miles from the station and Becky’s 
 mother, Susan Siegel, told WFLD Fox 32 News, "He was apparently very 
 friendly and chatty, and was talking about pedestrians crossing where 
 they shouldn't." Once she arrived at her destination, the student 
 asked the cab driver if she could use her credit card for the fare. “He 
 gave her a price and she thinks it was, you know, under ten dollars,” 
 explained Susan. “And so she said, ‘Can I use a credit card?’ And he said,
