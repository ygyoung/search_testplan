        <p>No, he didn't say it; no politician does; instead, he proves it, by 
 both what he does and what he says (as will be shown here).</p>
        <p>Of course, there's pretense in at least some of what all successful 
 politicians say, because success in politics requires at least some degree 
 of pretense. No matter how good a person is, pretense is necessary for 
 success in politics; that's just reality. We live with it; we deal with 
 it, if we are at all realistic.</p>
        <p>A politician shows his values, and makes clear his priorities, not by 
 what he says, but instead by what he actually does.</p>
        <p>For example, President Obama's 24 January 2012 State of the Union Address 
 said: "Tonight, I'm asking my Attorney General to create a special 
 unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand 
 our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages 
 that led to the housing crisis. (Applause.) This new unit will hold accountable 
 those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn 
 the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. Now, a 
 return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will 
 help protect our people and our economy."</p>
        <p>But, two years later, the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of 
 Justice issued on 13 March 2014 its "Audit of the Department of Justice's 
 Efforts to Address Mortgage Fraud," and reported that it turned out 
 to be just a lie. DOJ didn't even try; and they lied even about their 
 efforts. The IG found: "DOJ did not uniformly ensure that mortgage 
 fraud was prioritized at a level commensurate with its public statements. 
 For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Investigative 
 Division ranked mortgage fraud as the lowest criminal threat in its lowest 
 crime category. Additionally, we found mortgage fraud to be a low priority, 
 or not [even] listed as a priority, for the FBI Field Offices we visited." 
 Not just that, but, "Many Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSA) 
 informed us about underreporting and misclassification of mortgage fraud 
 cases." This was important because, "Capturing such information 
 would allow DOJ to ... better evaluate its performance in targeting high-profile 
 offenders."</p>
        <p>On 27 March 2009, Obama had assembled the top executives of the bailed-out 
 financial firms in a secret meeting at the White House and he assured 
 them that he would cover their backs; he told them "My administration 
 is the only thing between you and the pitchforks" (but of course 
 it's not on the White House website; it had to be leaked out, which is 
 one of the reasons Obama hates leakers). What the DOJ's IG indicated was, 
 in effect, that Obama had kept his secret promise to them.</p>
        <p>He had lied to the public, all along. According to the DOJ, their Financial 
 Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) was "established by President 
 Barack Obama in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive 
 effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes." But, according 
 to the Department's IG, it was all a fraud: a fraud that according to 
 the DOJ itself had been going on since at least November 2009.</p>
        <p>The IG's report continued by pointing out the Attorney General's lies, 
 noting that on 9 October 2012, "the FFETF held a press conference 
 to publicize the results of the initiative," and:</p>
        <p>"The Attorney General announced that the initiative resulted in 
 530 criminal defendants being charged, including 172 executives, in 285 
 criminal indictments or informations filed in federal courts throughout 
 the United States during the previous 12 months. The Attorney General 
 also announced that 110 federal civil cases were filed against over 150 
 defendants for losses totaling at least $37 million, and involving more 
 than 15,000 victims. According to statements made at the press conference, 
 these cases involved more than 73,000 homeowner victims and total losses 
 estimated at more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>"Shortly after this press conference, we requested documentation 
 that supported the statistics presented. ... Over the following months, 
 we repeatedly asked the Department about its efforts to correct the statistics. 
 ... Specifically, the number of criminal defendants charged as part of 
 the initiative was 107, not 530 as originally reported; and the total 
 estimated losses associated with true Distressed Homeowners cases were 
 $95 million, 91 percent less than the $1 billion reported at the October 
 2012 press conference. ...</p>
        <p>"Despite being aware of the serious flaws in these statistics since 
 at least November 2012, we found that the Department continued to cite 
 them in mortgage fraud press releases. ... According to DOJ officials, 
 the data collected and publicly announced for an earlier FFETF mortgage 
 fraud initiative - Operation Stolen Dreams - also may have contained similar 
 errors."</p>
        <p>Basically, the IG's report said that the Obama Administration had failed 
 to enforce the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009. The bill had 
 been passed overwhelmingly, 92-4 in the Senate, and 338-52 in the House. 
 All of the votes against it came from Republicans. This law, which sent 
 $165 million to the DOJ to catch the executive fraudsters who had brought 
 down the U.S. economy, and which set up the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 
 had been introduced and written by the liberal Democratic Senator Patrick 
 Leahy. President Obama signed it on 20 May 2009, with a smile but a tight 
 upper lip, and with a gun held by Democrats to his head: he just couldn't 
 afford to display, so early in his Administration, that he was far to 
 the right of every congressional Democrat. He needed the pretense that 
 he was a progressive.</p>
        <p>Already on 15 November 2011, Syracuse University's TRAC Reports had 
 headlined "Criminal Prosecutions for Financial Institution Fraud 
 Continue to Fall," and provided a chart showing that whereas such 
 prosecutions had been running at a fairly steady rate until George W. 
 Bush came into office in 2001, they immediately plunged during his term 
 and were continuing that decline under Obama, even after the biggest boom 
 in alleged financial fraud cases since right before the Great Depression. 
 And, then, on 24 September 2013, TRAC Reports bannered "Slump in 
 FBI White Collar Crime Prosecutions," and said that "prosecutions 
 of white collar criminals recommended by the FBI are substantially down 
 during the first ten months of Fiscal Year 2013." This was especially 
 so in the Wall Street area: "In the last year, the judicial District 
 Court recording the largest projected drop in the rate of white collar 
 crime prosecutions -- 27.8 percent -- was the Southern District of New 
 York (Manhattan)."</p>
        <p>Anyone who doubts that Obama is a liar (except when addressing banksters 
 in private), whose actual values are often the exact opposite of his sanctimonious 
 public statements, should read not only the IG's report, but, regarding 
 other issues, things such as,</p>
        <p>from Wayne Madsen, "UKRAINIAN PHONE WRECKS: The Secret Agenda of 
 Ashton and Nuland Revealed";</p>
        <p>and, from Marcy Wheeler, "The White House Has Been Covering Up 
 the Presidency's Role in Torture for Years";</p>
        <p>and, from Lee Fang, "Obama Admin's TPP Trade Officials Received 
 Hefty Bonuses From Big Banks";</p>
        <p>and, from Kate Sheppard, "Michael Froman, Top U.S. Trade Official, 
 Sides With Tar Sands Advocates In EU Negotiations."</p>
        <p>and then, add in, for good measure, an article by a courageous Ukrainian, 
 about how profoundly fascist are the people that the Obama Administration 
 has installed in Ukraine, "The Nazis Even Hitler Was Afraid Of."</p>
        <p>And the State Department was at least as bad under Hillary Clinton.</p>
        <p>If Barack Obama were competing with George W. Bush to become the new 
 worst U.S. President of all time, then one could say that he is doing 
 a brilliant job.</p>
        <p>But one thing's for sure: he's a terrific liar, whenever he's speaking 
 in public.</p>
        <p>Why aren't Democrats in Congress pressing for him to be impeached? There 
 are so many sound reasons why he ought to be forced out of office. But 
 none of them are reasons that Republicans hate him. Republicans hate him 
 because, no matter how far to the right a Democrat is, Republicans demand 
 someone who is even farther to the right, and Obama isn't leaving them 
 much territory to the right of himself; so, he's driving them into territory 
 that makes everyone except perhaps the Koch brothers and their friends 
 feel a bit sour.</p>
