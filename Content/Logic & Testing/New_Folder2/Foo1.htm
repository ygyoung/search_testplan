        <p>Just received a bad review in your company inbox? Ok. Do. Not. Panic. 
 The first common reaction a lot of businesses have is to take it personally. 
 But, if you do so, the natural reaction is to become defensive or even 
 remove the comment and act like it never existed. This is not the way 
 of handling reviews! If you deal with bad reviews the right way, they 
 could end up helping you rather than hurting you!</p>
        <p>The first step is to take a look at the bigger picture. Is the comment 
 damaging/relevant/vulgar/etc.? Take this into account when creating a 
 response. Justified negative reviews require appropriate compensation 
 (refunds, coupons, etc.). However, it’s also possible that you come across 
 people who are simply frustrated and take it out on your business. Don’t 
 respond immediately, and perhaps talk it over with a colleague to prevent 
 you from reacting in a way you might regret.</p>
        <p>How Should You Respond To a Bad Review?</p>
        <p>Even negative reviews can serve a positive purpose. They’re an outlet 
 to show off your great customer service! But, for this bad review to have 
 a happy ending, you will first need to respond the right way. Here are 
 some tips that do the trick:</p>
        <p>Never remove a bad review. Always respond in an appropriate manner.</p>
        <p>Keep your response professional…</p>
        <p>…but also make sure you show empathy. Acknowledge how disappointing 
 or upsetting the situation must have been. Some people just want to be 
 heard.</p>
        <p>If you owe the customer an apology, then apologize.</p>
        <p>In some cases you aren’t wrong, so don’t apologize. You should apologize 
 for their bad experience but not for making a mistake (which you didn’t).</p>
        <p>If appropriate, thank the commenter. Constructive feedback is important 
 and improves your business. Show the reviewer that you appreciate them 
 taking the time to comment and allowing you to address the situation.</p>
        <p>Some Things to Keep in Mind</p>
        <p>Regularly keep up with reviews, and make sure you know where to look 
 for them. The faster you react, the better. If you leave a bad review 
 unanswered for too long, reviews for your poor online customer service 
 will increase.</p>
        <p>Don’t forget about the people who come across bad online reviews. That’s 
 why it’s important to respond publicly for everyone to see. However, if 
 the website doesn’t allow you to respond publicly, make sure you leave 
 a reply anyway. Show you care and want to use the feedback to improve 
 your business.</p>
        <p>A bad review can be overshadowed by a lot of positive reviews. Always 
 encourage happy customers to leave a review.</p>
        <p>&#160;And Now: How NOT to Respond</p>
        <p>Some companies really don’t have a clue how to respond properly to a 
 bad review. Amy’s Baking Company is one of them. Their recent appearance 
 in Gordon Ramsay’s “Kitchen Nightmares” didn’t turn out well at all. Their 
 response to comments was so poor that things escalated to the point of 
 ridiculously unprofessional behavior.</p>
