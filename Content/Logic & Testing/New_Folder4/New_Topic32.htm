        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Get ready for Janet Yellen's first policymaking meeting as head of the 
 Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>The Fed is set to meet this Tuesday and Wednesday to mull over the latest 
 economic data, issue new forecasts and re-evaluate its plan for winding 
 down its stimulus program. Here are the top things to look for:</p>
        <p>1) Tapering will continue: The central bank has been buying trillions 
 in bonds since late 2008 in an effort to lower long-term interest rates. 
 The goal: Stimulate the economy by making it cheaper to take out loans.</p>
        <p>But the Fed has determined it's time to start winding down that stimulus 
 program. Since December, the central bank has been slowly reducing its 
 bond purchases at each meeting, in a process Wall Street has dubbed "tapering." 
 The Fed was previously buying $85 billion in bonds each month, then reduced 
 the amount to $75 billion in January, and then $65 billion in February.</p>
        <p>Economists expect a similar reduction in bond purchases will be announced 
 at the upcoming meeting, especially given Yellen's comments before a Congressional 
 committee last month. "We expect to continue reducing the pace of 
 purchases in measured steps," she said.</p>
        <p>2) The goalposts will change: The Fed has kept its key short-term interest 
 rate near zero since 2008, also as a way to stimulate more spending.</p>
        <p>Investors have become accustomed to low interest rates but are looking 
 for signals about when the Fed might eventually raise rates as the economy 
 strengthens.</p>
        <p>So far, the Fed has said it wants to see the unemployment rate fall 
 to around 6.5%, or inflation rise as high as 2.5%, before it will be ready 
 to raise rates. But here's the problem: The unemployment rate, at 6.7% 
 in February, is already nearing that point, and Yellen still thinks the 
 economy is too weak.</p>
        <p>She may want to abandon the numerical targets altogether and focus on 
 qualitative information instead.</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate alone is "not a sufficient statistic to measure 
 the health of the labor market," she told Senators last month.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, New York Fed President Bill Dudley has said the 6.5% unemployment 
 rate "is already obsolete." It's a "reasonable time to 
 revamp" the Fed statement to take out that threshold, he said at 
 a Wall Street Journal event last week.</p>
        <p>3) Weather puts the Fed in wait-and-see mode: Severe winter storms throughout 
 much of the country weighed on economic data over the last few months, 
 making it hard to get a clean reading on the recovery. Retail sales, job 
 growth, housing and manufacturing all seem to have been impacted, but 
 it's unclear whether the slowdown was temporary.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="search" />"The question is how much of this activity comes back in the spring, 
 how much is simply lost, and how much the slowdown reflects other factors..." 
 Julia Coronado, chief North American economist for BNP Paribas, wrote 
 in a research note.</p>
        <p>Related: Yellen blames it on the weather</p>
        <p>Coronado expects the Fed will acknowledge the harsh winter in its policy 
 statement and may even nudge some of its economic forecasts lower for 
 the year.</p>
        <p>That said, Yellen is still expected to express some optimism about the 
 economy picking up in the spring.</p>
        <p>Yellen: 'I am a sensible central banker' &#160;</p>
        <p>Yellen: 'I am a sensible central banker'</p>
        <p>4) Yellen is still focused on jobs, jobs, jobs: Following the Fed's 
 meeting, Yellen will take questions from reporters in a press conference 
 Wednesday afternoon. She's likely to emphasize that she remains deeply 
 concerned about ongoing weakness in the labor market.</p>
        <p>As of February, 3.8 million Americans were unemployed for at least six 
 months, and 7.2 million workers were stuck in part-time jobs, even though 
 they would prefer full-time hours. Yellen looks closely at both measures, 
 and neither has improved much lately.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, inflation remains well under the Fed's goal for 2% over the 
 long-run, so Yellen is unlikely to view rising prices as a major concern.
