        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Recent headlines about recalls haven't been great for General Motors. 
 But there has been little impact at used and new car lots.</p>
        <p>Despite an ignition switch problem tied to 12 deaths, the out-of-production 
 models recalled by GM continue to attract customer interest, according 
 to sales and price trackers Kelley Blue Book and Cars.com.</p>
        <p>The services say prices for most of the vehicles involved -- Chevrolet 
 Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac's G5 and Solstice, and Saturn's Sky and Ion -- 
 are up slightly or unchanged. About 1.6 million of the cars, from model 
 years 2003 through 2007, have been recalled by the automaker.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons that pricing has held up is that the number of recalled 
 models available for sale has declined due to normal seasonal factors. 
 There are traditionally fewer used cars on sale in March compared to earlier 
 in the year.</p>

        <p>Another reason pricing has remained firm is that the cars are not very 
 expensive to begin with. On average, they have about 100,000 miles on 
 them, so they usually cost between $4,000 to $8,000, said Kelley analyst 
 Alec Gutierrez.</p>
        <p>"People shopping these cars are shopping for bargains," he 
 said. "These prices tend to move pretty broadly, and pretty slowly."</p>
        <p>The price figures were collected before the latest GM recall announced 
 Monday, affecting 1.2 million crossover SUVs, 300,000 full-size commercial 
 vans and 65,000 Cadillacs. Unlike the ignition recall, there were no deaths 
 or injuries associated with the latest recalls.</p>

        <p>It was too soon to judge any impact of the latest recall on those sales 
 prices.</p>
        <p>GM's new car sales are also unlikely to take a big hit, according to 
 experts. The company's current vehicles have received much better marks 
 on quality than the poor quality cars that helped take the automaker into 
 bankruptcy in 2009. . In fact, GM was named highest quality automaker 
 by J.D. Power in 2013 for the first time in its history.</p>

        <p>"My gut says GM has not lost the goodwill that it's built up in 
 the last few years," said Gutierrez. "Provided that GM is able 
 to get this fix out there, and we don't get a new story about severity 
 getting worse, this will pass for GM."</p>
        <p>Past history with high-profile recalls, such as the instances of unintended 
 acceleration with Toyota in 2010, and the Ford Explorer/Firestone recall 
 in 2000, also suggest sales of all GM vehicles won't take a hit.</p>
        <p>"History says customer's reactions to recalls are never as negative 
 as one would think," said Jesse Toprak, chief analyst with Cars.com.
