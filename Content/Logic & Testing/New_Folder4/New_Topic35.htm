        <p>LONDON (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>The U.K. has unveiled a new 12-sided pound coin that is being hailed 
 as the most secure coin in the world.</p>
        <p>The Royal Mint will begin replacing existing round £1 coins in 2017 
 in a bid to stamp out fraud. It estimates that 3% of £1 coins -- or nearly 
 £46 million ($76 million) -- are fakes.</p>
        <p>But it's not just criminals who will find life harder after the switch. 
 Retailers, vending machine operators and other small firms could face 
 costs to alter coin slots.</p>
        <p>"We do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new 
 pound coin. For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery," 
 said John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>
        <p>But he also noted that these same firms tend to suffer the most from 
 unknowingly accepting counterfeit currencies.</p>

        <p>Officials will hold a public consultation later this year to try to 
 reduce the impact on business.</p>
        <p>The Mint says the coins will make use of new security features already 
 used in bills to keep criminals at bay.</p>
        <p>"It is the first time that this existing security has been successfully 
 embedded into coins," it said in a statement.</p>

        <p>The new coin, which will be made with two metals, was designed to look 
 like the old threepence piece. The current £1 coin was introduced 30 years 
 ago.</p>

        <p>The U.K. has taken other steps to protect its currency from counterfeiters. 
 The Bank of England said in December it would start issuing plastic banknotes 
 in 2016.</p>
        <p>The new polymer notes are expected to be cleaner, more secure and more 
 durable than their old paper counterparts.</p>
        <p>More than 25 countries already use these high tech polymer banknotes, 
 including Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and Canada. &#160;To
