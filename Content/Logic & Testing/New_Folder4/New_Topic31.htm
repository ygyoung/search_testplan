        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Oil booms have always been transitory affairs.</p>
        <p>In 1859, thousands followed "Colonel" Edwin Drake into the 
 Pennsylvania forest after America's first major oil well was discovered 
 near Titusville. In 1901, people flooded Beaumont, Texas, when Spindletop 
 gushed.</p>
        <p>In 2010, Amy Savage migrated from her native Michigan to western Pennsylvania, 
 chasing the Marcellus Shale boom.</p>
        <p>The plan was to move to Pennsylvania and expand the small trucking company 
 she ran with her boyfriend in Michigan. Four years later, she sells millions 
 of dollars worth of fireproof clothing and safety equipment out of two 
 retail stores, with a third on the way.</p>
        <p>How she started: Back in Michigan, Savage, 32, and her boyfriend owned 
 a company that specialized in moving oil field equipment from well to 
 well. They had three flatbed trucks and a handful of employees.</p>
        <p>But Michigan isn't a huge oil-producing state, and things were relatively 
 sleepy. The Marcellus -- the vast, gas-rich geologic formation under the 
 Appalachian Mountains -- was a whole different story. Fracking had unlocked 
 vast new energy supplies, and a boom was in full swing.</p>
        <p>The boom has been an economic jolt not only to Western Pennsylvania 
 but parts of Texas, Colorado, North Dakota and Ohio. And it isn't just 
 big oil companies that benefit. The conservative Manhattan Institute estimates 
 that 20,000 small and midsized firms related to the oil industry have 
 injected $300 to $400 billion into the U.S. economy over the last few 
 years.</p>

        <p>Savage was well-poised to take advantage of that. The idea for her new 
 business hit her while she was trying to buy fireproof hooded sweatshirts 
 to give her trucking employees for a training event.</p>
        <p>"There just wasn't a store around that offered this clothing at 
 worker prices," she said. Later, a customer told her he'd driven 
 two and a half hours to find proper work boots.</p>
        <p>She moved quickly. In January 2012, she wrote a business plan, and then 
 used $50,000 in savings to rent space in a former hair salon and buy inventory 
 -- hard hats, gloves, safety glasses, work boots and flame-resistant clothing. 
 In April 2012, she opened Oil and Gas Safety Supply in Washington, Pa.</p>

        <p>Savage's Ohio store is located an old barn. "It was a cool, manly 
 place," she said. "And I'm selling gear for men."</p>
        <p>How it grew: Sales were brisk from the start. The hard part was figuring 
 out what the workers wanted and keeping up with inventory. She polled 
 friends, asked customers for advice, and looked in field manuals for the 
 type of gear oil and gas companies required. She wanted to carry name 
 brands like Carhartt, but didn't have the $10,000 required for an initial 
 order. That would soon change.</p>
        <p>Savage sold $500,000 in her first year. She put all of it toward inventory 
 and opening a second, larger location 40 miles away in St. Clairsville, 
 Ohio. In 2013, sales topped $2 million. She's opening a third store in 
 April and expects sales to hit $3.5 million this year. At that point, 
 she expects to have 20 employees and plans to continue investing the profits 
 into inventory and expansion.</p>
        <p>Savage has made a point to cater to what her customers need. For example, 
 she now has a truck that delivers orders directly to the job site and 
 she designed her own line of specialized clothing.</p>

        <p>Savage knows that someday the boom will end. The wells will be drilled, 
 the workers will move on. She doesn't let it get her down.</p>
        <p>"I figure we have at least another 10 years," she said &#160;To
