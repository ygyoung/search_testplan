        <p>Thanks to the oil boom, North Dakota has thousands of jobs to fill.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Looking for a job? North Dakota wants you.</p>
        <p>In a new recruiting campaign to be rolled out in May, the North Dakota 
 Economic Development Foundation is aiming to fill more than 20,000 jobs 
 -- ranging from truck drivers and oilfield workers to receptionists and 
 food servers.</p>
        <p>North Dakota's huge oil boom has spurred thousands of job seekers to 
 flock to the state for years now. In some cities, the population has quadrupled.</p>
        <p>Yet, the growth continues and companies are still so desperate for workers 
 that the state is teaming up with oil giant Hess Corp. (HES, Fortune 500) 
 to launch an $800,000 campaign to attract new talent.</p>
        <p>Related: How to get talented people to work in the middle of nowhere</p>
        <p>"It is being developed to target people in states with chronic 
 unemployment, and people in industries that are high-demand in North Dakota, 
 including: engineering, healthcare, energy, skilled trades, transportation 
 and information technology," the foundation said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The push will include a website, marketing efforts and recruiting events.</p>

        <p>The state is also trying to convince potential employees that North 
 Dakota is not only a good place to get a job, but a great place to live, 
 dubbing it the "Find the Good Life in North Dakota" campaign.</p>
        <p>But this could be a harder sell.</p>

        <p>Over the past few years, the flood of workers moving to the state -- 
 specifically to the Northwest corner where oil activity is greatest -- 
 has caused a severe housing shortage.</p>
        <p>In Williston, a town at the center of the boom, home prices have more 
 than tripled and rent there is currently the highest in the nation, according 
 to a new report from Apartment Guide, a website for finding apartment 
 rentals.</p>
        <p>Even though many employees are now raking in six-figure salaries, they 
 are essentially homeless, living in their cars in parking lots, in other 
 peoples' basements, in RVs or even in churches.</p>
        <p>Along with a housing crunch, crime has skyrocketed, traffic is grueling, 
 and local restaurants and retailers struggle to keep up with the surge 
 in demand -- resulting in higher prices and longer waits.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there's always the below-freezing temperatures, with 
 wind chills plunging under negative 50 during the winters. &#160;To top
