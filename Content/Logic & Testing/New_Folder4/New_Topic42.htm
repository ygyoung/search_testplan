        <p>GM: Steps to a recall nightmare</p>
        <p>These are the events that led up to GM’s worldwide recall of 1.6 million 
 cars, blamed for at least 12 deaths.</p>
        <p>2001 Saturn Ion glitch</p>
        <p>During pre-production testing, GM engineers experience problems with 
 ignition switches on the Ion.</p>
        <p>At issue: A mechanism that is supposed to hold the ignition key in place. 
 According to GM, an internal report indicates the problem was solved when 
 the switch was redesigned.</p>
        <p>2003</p>
        <p>A GM service technician sees a Saturn Ion stall while it is being driven 
 with "several other keys on the key ring." The technician writes 
 in his report that "the additional weight of the keys had worn out 
 the ignition switch."</p>
        <p>2004</p>
        <p>A GM engineer bumps the key in a Chevrolet Cobalt during testing, causing 
 it to abruptly lose power.</p>
        <p>2005 Stalling Cobalts</p>
        <p>GM receives more reports of Chevrolet Cobalts losing power when keys 
 are accidentally bumped or moved out of the "Run" position.</p>
        <p>Engineers propose that the head of the key be redesigned so that things 
 hanging from the key are less likely to jostle it. That proposal is initially 
 approved, but then cancelled.</p>
        <p>GM issues a “Service Bulletin” advising dealers to tell vehicle owners 
 to take “unessential items” off their car key chains. The bulletin applies 
 to all the models that would ultimately be recalled.</p>
        <p>2006</p>
        <p>Delphi, the company that makes the switch, proposes an ignition design 
 change. A GM engineer signs off on the changes and the new part goes into 
 production. But the part number is not changed, so most of the automaker’s 
 employees are not aware of the fix.</p>
        <p>GM dealers hand out "key inserts" to limit the key’s movement 
 to 474 owners of models later recalled.</p>
        <p>2007</p>
        <p>GM begins installing the new, redesigned switch on 2007 model year cars.</p>
        <p>During an unrelated meeting with auto safety regulators, GM employees 
 are informed of a fatal 2005 Cobalt crash in which airbags did not deploy. 
 By the end of the year, GM is aware of 10 deadly Cobalt accidents in which 
 airbags failed.</p>
        <p>A GM engineer is assigned to look at Cobalt front crashes in which the 
 airbags did not deploy, in order to identify common characteristics. In 
 four of nine crashes, the ignition was not in "Run" at the time 
 of impact.</p>
        <p>2011</p>
        <p>A new investigation is opened into front crashes of Cobalts and Pontiac 
 G5s where airbags did not deploy. Ignition switches are removed from cars 
 in salvage yards and tested.</p>
        <p>2012</p>
        <p>Engineers notice all the crashes in which the ignition was switched 
 out of "Run" only happened in cars from the 2007 model year 
 and earlier.</p>
        <p>2013</p>
        <p>GM investigators notice that ignition switches in cars built in later 
 years are less prone to moving out of position than ignitions in earlier 
 models.</p>
        <p>GM hires outside engineers to conduct a thorough assessment of ignition 
 switches from cars made before and after 2007. They conclude that changes 
 were made to the ignition switch sometime after the cars ﬁrst went into 
 production.</p>
        <p>A GM committee is asked to consider a recall of Chevrolet Cobalt and 
 Pontiac G5 cars from the 2007 model year and earlier.</p>
        <p>2014</p>
        <p>February 7: GM initiates a recall on about 800,000 Chevrolet Cobalt 
 and Pontiac G5 vehicles.</p>
        <p>February 24: GM adds 600,000 Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn 
 Ion and Saturn Sky vehicles to the recall.</p>
        <p>February 27: U.S. auto safety regulator says it is investigating whether 
 GM responded quickly enough to the ignition switch problem.</p>
        <p>March 4: GM CEO Mary Barra defends how the company is handling the much-criticized 
 recall, but pledges to conduct an internal review. "We will hold 
 ourselves accountable and improve our processes so our customers do not 
 experience this again." Says repairs to recalled cars should start 
 in early April.</p>
        <p>March 10: GM appoints two outside legal firms to assist with an internal 
 investigation of the events leading up to this recall.</p>
        <p>March 12: The Justice Department announces a criminal investigation 
 into why the recall was delayed.</p>
        <p>March 17: Barra issues a new statement on the automakers' handling of 
 a flawed ignition switch, calling it a tragic situation in which "terrible 
 things happened." Says GM will change the way it handles recalls, 
 and that repairs "should start" the second week of April.</p>
