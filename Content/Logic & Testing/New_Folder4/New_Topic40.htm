        <p>Toyota's huge fine won't dent its $60 billion cash pile</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Toyota Motor has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a criminal probe 
 into its conduct during its massive unintended acceleration recall four 
 years ago. But for the world's richest automaker, that shouldn't be a 
 problem.</p>
        <p>By paying the fine, Toyota will avoid prosecution for making what the 
 Justice Department charges were deceptive statements to customers, safety 
 regulators and Congress.</p>
        <p>"Toyota...cared more about savings than safety and more about its 
 own brand and bottom line than the truth," said U.S. Attorney Preet 
 Bharara for the Southern District of New York.</p>
        <p>It is the largest fine of its kind ever paid by an automaker. But Toyota's 
 most recent balance sheet shows cash and cash equivalents of about ¥6 
 trillion, or just under $60 billion. Toyota's (TM) pile of cash dwarfs 
 the reserves of rivals such as Volkswagen, General Motors (GM, Fortune 
 500) and Ford Motor (F, Fortune 500).</p>
        <p>Japan's efforts to hold down the value of the yen helps make Japanese 
 exports more competitive, and keeps Toyota flush. The currency's cheap 
 value means that Toyota sales in the United States, which is its largest 
 market, and other countries around the world, will translate into more 
 yen for the automaker.</p>

        <p>Additionally, Toyota isn't under as much pressure to pay large dividends 
 as many other cash-rich companies. For instance, Tim Cook and the Apple 
 (AAPL, Fortune 500) board were pressured by Carl Icahn to distribute some 
 of its huge cash stockpile to shareholders. But there are few equivalents 
 of Icahn in Japan, said S&amp;P credit analyst Chizuko Satsukawa.</p>
