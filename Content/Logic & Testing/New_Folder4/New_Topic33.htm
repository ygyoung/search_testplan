        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Russia and the United States have levers to pull in their diplomatic 
 showdown over Ukraine, but the amount of U.S. debt held by Russia won't 
 be one of them.</p>
        <p>For one, Russia owns a fairly modest amount of U.S. Treasuries -- and 
 that figure is shrinking. So even if Russia dumped its holdings, it wouldn't 
 have much of an impact.</p>
        <p>Figures released Tuesday by the U.S. Treasury Department show Russia 
 owned $132 billion worth of Treasuries at the end of January, down 5% 
 from December.</p>
        <p>That might seem like a lot, but it's just a little more than 10% of 
 what China or Japan hold -- more than $1 trillion each. And it places 
 it just behind tiny Luxembourg, which owns $135 billion.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, even if the U.S. imposes further sanctions on Russia, it 
 might have trouble freezing its Treasury holdings. That's because Russia 
 might have just moved a large chunk out of an account at the U.S. Federal 
 Reserve.</p>
        <p>A report released by the Fed last week showed that the total amount 
 of Treasuries held by the U.S. central bank for foreign governments fell 
 by more than $100 billion, marking the biggest weekly decline on record.</p>
        <p>The Fed does not break out who it's holding the Treasuries for, but 
 the amount of the decline, combined with earlier data on Russia's holdings, 
 led bond traders and experts to assume Russia had decided to move its 
 holdings instead of selling.</p>

        <p>"It's speculation but it appears that the Russians decided to move 
 some Treasuries to some place a little farther removed from Treasury's 
 reach," said Lou Crandall at Wrightson ICAP. "If that much had 
 been dumped in outright sales, it would have been noticed by the market. 
 So the odds are that they were changing custody of the holdings."</p>

        <p>But Crandall said that even if Russia did decide to liquidate, rather 
 than simply move, its Treasuries, it wouldn't be enough to rattle a market 
 that includes foreign holdings of $5.8 trillion, and the Fed's $2.3 trillion.</p>
        <p>"There would be an initial impact while people try to figure out 
 what was happening," said Crandall. "But once it became clear, 
 given that the limited magnitude of the Russian holdings, even concentrated 
 selling would have only transitory impact." &#160;To top of page</p>
