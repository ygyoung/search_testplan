        <p>Got Obamacare, can't find doctors</p>

        <p>Terri Durheim and her family had to switch doctors when they bought 
 an Obamacare policy.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Terri Durheim and her family now have health insurance, thanks to Obamacare. 
 What they don't have are local doctors and hospitals who will take it.</p>
        <p>This worries the Enid, Okla., resident since she has a teenage son with 
 a serious heart condition. They now have to find a pediatric cardiologist 
 in Oklahoma City, more than an hour away.</p>
        <p>And if there's an emergency ... "obviously we'd have to pay out 
 of pocket and go here in town, but that defeats the purpose of insurance. 
 I'm truly grateful we have insurance. It's reasonable and affordable, 
 but it's not doing me a lot of good," said Durheim, who just had 
 to drive 90 minutes to Stillwater, Okla., for a CAT scan for herself. 
 "It's so frustrating."</p>
        <p>Like Durheim, many Americans who've enrolled on the Obamacare exchanges 
 are realizing they have access to a relatively limited set of doctors 
 and hospitals. In many areas, the largest hospitals are not participating 
 and many doctors are not accepting the coverage.</p>
        <p>That's by design. To keep premiums down for silver and bronze plans, 
 insurers narrowed the networks of doctors and hospitals, often excluding 
 the priciest and most specialized providers.</p>
        <p>"The unavoidable truth is that health care costs are growing faster 
 than people's income," said Sara Collins, a vice president for the 
 health care coverage and access program at the Commonwealth Fund. "Narrow 
 networks are a reflection of that."</p>
        <p>Related: Doctor choice in Obamacare? Not so much</p>
        <p>Limiting access to providers isn't new, but it is becoming more common 
 as the Obamacare exchanges expand coverage to more people. So many people 
 have complained that the Obama administration said last week it will require 
 insurers in 2015 to maintain networks that provide enrollees with access 
 to doctors "without unreasonable delay."</p>
        <p>McKinsey looked at how hospital access in 20 cities has changed over 
 the past year for those buying individual policies. Last year, 33% of 
 the offerings contained narrow networks. This year, the same carriers 
 are offering more policies, but 68% of the options have limited networks.</p>
        <p>Narrow networks were defined in the study as those with fewer than 70% 
 of the city's top 20 hospitals participating.</p>
        <p>Narrow networks, however, don't mean inferior care, said Jessica Ogden, 
 associate partner in McKinsey's healthcare practice. The hospitals in 
 the narrower networks scored similarly in the Centers for Medicare and 
 Medicaid Services' quality and patient satisfaction metrics.</p>
        <p>Some Americans, particularly those who were uninsured before, may not 
 care if they can only go to certain providers. But others are dismayed 
 that their current doctors aren't in the plans or that they can't go to 
 the ones they think are best for them. Still, others say there are local 
 doctors listed in their networks, but they can't get appointments or the 
 providers aren't accepting new patients.</p>
        <p>Share your story: Have you begun using your Obamacare benefits?</p>
        <p>Compounding the problem is that many enrollees had a tough time getting 
 the list of providers in particular plans in the exchanges. Some had technical 
 trouble accessing the information, while others found the lists were inaccurate 
 or incomplete.</p>
        <p>That's what happened to Durheim, who owns a small appliance store with 
 her husband. She called her doctors and hospitals, who said they take 
 Blue Cross Blue Shield. So she picked a silver preferred plan with a low 
 deductible for $328 a month.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="search" />Her mistake, she acknowledged, was that she didn't look specifically 
 at the provider network for "preferred" plans on the Blue Cross 
 website, instead searching the network for all tiers Blue Cross offers. 
 So she didn't realize that these providers don't take her plan until she 
 wanted to use it.</p>
        <p>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma said that she can upgrade the policy 
 to a "choice" plan, which may cost her between $50 and $100 
 more a month, through healthcare.gov. But the site will not let her switch, 
 and the exchange representatives said she'll have to wait until next year. 
 A Blue Cross spokeswoman said the insurer will help her switch plans now.
