        <p>The president is well-known for his love of basketball, as he played 
 the sport in high school and has organized some high-profile pickup games 
 at the White House.</p>
        <p>Because of that, it is only natural that President Obama fills out a 
 bracket just like millions of other Americans do on a yearly basis. As 
 is often the case when it comes to predicting the chaos of March Madness, 
 the president's knowledge doesn't always lead to great results.</p>
        <p>According to ESPN.com, the president has picked the correct national 
 champion just once. That came back in 2009 when he selected the North 
 Carolina Tar Heels.</p>
        <p>President Obama did perform admirably last year, finishing in 2,080,996th 
 place out of 8.15 million ESPN.com bracket entries, placing him in the 
 74.4th percentile.</p>
        <p>Here is a closer look at the key aspects of President Obama's 2014 bracket 
 entry as he tries to make sense of March Madness.</p>

        <p>Final Four</p>

        <p>If there were any questions about whether or not President Obama closely 
 follows the sport of college basketball, they were answered in the form 
 of his Final Four selections. Obama's picks were a mix of sensibility 
 and trendiness as he advanced No. 1 seeds Florida and Arizona as well 
 as No. 4 seeds Louisville and Michigan State to Arlington, Texas, per 
 ESPN.com.</p>
        <p>Florida is the No. 1 team in the nation and the top overall seed in 
 the tournament, so picking the Gators to advance out of the South Region 
 doesn't come as a big surprise. The same can be said for Arizona in the 
 West, as it has been among the top teams in the country all season long.</p>
        <p>Louisville and Michigan State may be No. 4 seeds, but they are playing 
 better than perhaps any other team right now. The Cardinals won the American 
 Athletic Conference title and were considered candidates for a No. 1 seed. 
 Louisville won the national title last year, and Rick Pitino's squad is 
 in fine form once again.</p>
        <p>The Spartans are always a factor in March, and even though they weren't 
 being talked about much as potential contenders just a few weeks ago, 
 Tom Izzo's team went on an impressive run to win the Big Ten tournament. 
 Not only are Michigan State and Louisville red hot, but they have both 
 players and coaches who know how to win on the big stage.</p>
        <p>Adam Levitan of Rotoworld mentioned that some of Obama's Final Four 
 picks ranked as the trendiest of the tournament: </p>
        <p>According to ESPN.com, the president is especially impressed with Izzo's 
 ability to rally the troops come tournament time.</p>
        <p>"Tom Izzo is a great tournament coach," Obama said. "I've 
 got Michigan State going all the way."</p>
        <p>In winning the national title, President Obama has the Spartans getting 
 past Louisville in the championship game. The Cardinals return a strong 
 core that helped them win the national title last year, including Russ 
 Smith and Luke Hancock, but the president believes that Michigan State's 
 momentum will ultimately win out.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Some criticize the president for a lack of shocking selections, but 
 he feels as though his projected Final Four is correct albeit somewhat 
 predictable, per ESPN.com.</p>
        <p>"I know these are not imaginative picks, but I think they're the 
 right ones," Obama said.</p>
        <p>While Obama's recent history has been up and down in terms of bracket 
 predictions, he may very well be due for a strong showing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Upsets</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>One thing that really sticks out when it comes to President Obama's 
 bracket is a lack of upset picks. The president doesn't have any team 
 higher than a No. 4 seed reaching the Elite Eight, and his biggest Sweet 
 16 "longshots" are No. 6 North Carolina and No. 6 Ohio State.</p>
        <p>With that said, President Obama's bracket isn't completely devoid of 
 surprises. The president has a pair of No. 12 seeds advancing to the round 
 of 32, with Harvard defeating No. 5 Cincinnati in the East Region and 
 North Dakota State upending No. 5 Oklahoma in the West Region.</p>
        <p>Harvard played the spoiler role last year by taking out No. 3 New Mexico 
 as a No. 14 seed. While the pick makes basketball sense, perhaps it also 
 has something to do with the fact that the president attended Harvard 
 Law School, according to Justin Sink of The Hill:</p>
        <p>North Dakota State is also an interesting selection due largely to the 
 presence of senior guard Taylor Braun. He is perfectly capable of taking 
 games over for the Bison, and the Sooners figure to have their hands full 
 with him.</p>
        <p>The only other double-digit seed that President Obama has making it 
 out of the second round is No. 10 Arizona State. The Sun Devils will face 
 No. 7 seed Texas in the Midwest Region. That figures to be one of the 
 most intriguing matchups in the round of 64, and the president is banking 
 on a minor upset.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Handicapping President Obama's Chances</p>
        <p>Harry How/Getty Images</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the president decided to play it safe for the 
 most part, and while that should allow him to remain fairly competitive 
 in ESPN's bracket contest, it also caps his potential significantly.</p>
        <p>How will President Obama's bracket perform?</p>
        <p>It will be among the best.</p>
        <p>It will be in the middle of the pack.</p>
        <p>It will be among the worst.</p>
        <p>SUBMIT VOTE vote to see results</p>
        <p>Based on the amount of parity that exists in college basketball right 
 now, one can only assume that some big-time upsets are looming. The president 
 didn't chase them to his credit, but his conservative approach can only 
 take him so far.</p>
        <p>Also, since his Final Four and championship game selections are right 
 in line with what the majority of fans seem to believe, there isn't much 
 of an opportunity for him to differentiate himself.</p>
        <p>The president proved that he has great college basketball knowledge 
 once again, but don't expect him to win any bracket pools this year.</p>
