        <p>(CNN) -- A Downtown Disney restaurant in Florida sprang a leak Monday 
 as diners were enjoying their meals.</p>
        <p>A fish tank in the dinosaur-themed T-Rex Cafe's aquatic-themed area 
 suddenly sent water spewing toward guests.</p>
        <p>Restaurant patron Kate Wallace, who caught the incident on video, told 
 CNN affiliate Bay News 9 that restaurant workers rushed in to get people 
 out of the way and to save the fish in the tank.</p>
        <p>"A seal failed on the tank causing water to leak," said Keith 
 Beitler, a senior vice president of Landry's specialty restaurants division, 
 which owns and operates T-Rex Cafe, in a statement.</p>
        <p>"Employees took action and did a great job rescuing all of the 
 marine life, caring for our guests and managing the situation. The marine 
 life has been moved to holding tanks and the restaurant is open for business 
 as usual."</p>
        <p>Landry's confirms that all of the marine life were rescued alive.</p>
        <p>T-Rex is in the Downtown Disney complex, which includes restaurants, 
 entertainment and shops. Downtown Disney sits outside Disney's theme parks 
 in Orlando, and there aren't any entrance or parking fees to enter.</p>
