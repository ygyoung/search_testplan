        <p>Los Angeles (CNN) -- It's the stuff you might expect only to see on 
 TV or in movies -- the upbeat kind with happy endings.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, that is just what happened in Burbank, California -- the 
 Southern California city that's home to Warner Brothers and Walt Disney 
 studios -- as a toddler fell from three stories up into a stranger's arms 
 and onto a box spring mattress.</p>
        <p>"It feels like I watched a TV show, like it didn't happen to me," 
 Konrad Lightner, who identified himself as the man who caught the child 
 and fell with him, told CNN affiliate KABC.</p>
        <p>Sunday was moving day for Lightner and wife Jennifer, a typically exhausting 
 if not momentous endeavor.</p>
        <p>Until, that is, they spied a youngster hanging out of a third-story 
 window of an apartment building and called 911.</p>
        <p>According to Burbank fire Capt. Peter Hendrickson, calls for help came 
 shortly after 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), after witnesses saw the child 
 crawling out of the window.</p>
        <p>Enter the box spring.</p>
        <p>It was placed under the window, and although Hendrickson did not name 
 the Good Samaritans, the Lightners said it was their mattress and Konrad 
 Lightner's arms that came to the rescue.</p>
        <p>The toddler fell only to be caught, and together the toddler and the 
 catcher fell onto the box spring.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Lightner told KABC that the whole episode "didn't seem 
 real until he was hanging from (a) chord, because there was no way he 
 was going to get back." It was then, she added, that the couple threw 
 down their box spring mattress.</p>
        <p>"It (was) now up to Konrad to catch him," Jennifer Lightner 
 added.</p>
        <p>That's exactly what Konrad Lightner said he did, putting his arms around 
 the falling child "and lower(ing) him real fast to the box spring."</p>
        <p>Photos taken a short time later and posted on MyBurbank.com showed a 
 man -- clad in a T-shirt, shorts and no shoes -- cradling what appeared 
 to be his child on the box spring. Another shows the same man carrying 
 the child, surrounded by toys like Minnie Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants 
 dolls and as Jennifer Lightner holds the box spring upright.</p>
        <p>The youngster appeared to be dressed in footsie pajamas, with no signs 
 of trauma or obvious injuries.</p>
        <p>The child was transported to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said Hendrickson 
 of the Burbank fire department.</p>
        <p>Another photo shows a firefighter helping the Lightners carry away their 
 box spring, and one pictures Konrad Lightner being thanked by a firefighter.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Lightner described the happening as "very surreal," 
 all the more so considering the couple resumed the mundane task of moving 
 not long after.</p>
        <p>"I'm not a hero," her husband told KABC. "I just walked 
 by and just tried to help. Just something happened and were there.</p>
        <p>"We were lucky to be there."</p>
        <p>5,000 kids a year hurt in falls from windows</p>
        <p>CNN's Sonya Hamasaki reported from Los Angeles, and Greg Botelho reported 
 and wrote from Atlanta.</p>
