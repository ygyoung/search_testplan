        <p>(CNN) -- Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann 
 are looking for a man who assaulted five other young British girls on 
 vacation in Portugal, London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared while she was on vacation in the 
 Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz with her family in June 2007. Her 
 disappearance prompted headlines worldwide.</p>
        <p>Officers are investigating 12 potentially linked crimes at resorts near 
 where the toddler vanished.</p>
        <p>The man, whom witnesses describe as being tanned with short, dark, unkempt 
 hair, is suspected of breaking in to 12 vacation homes where British families 
 were staying in the Algarve between 2004 and 2010.</p>
        <p>In four of the incidents, girls between 7 and 10 years of age were sexually 
 assaulted in their beds. On one of these occasions, he assaulted two girls 
 in the same villa, police said. These attacks happened between 2004 and 
 2006.</p>
        <p>"Whilst not identical, there are many similar aspects to each of 
 the incidents in that in most cases there were no signs of forced entry 
 to the property, nothing was taken, and the intruder appeared in the early 
 hours of the morning," between 2 and 5 a.m., police said in a statement</p>
        <p>"The suspect may have been in the villa or looking round the villa 
 for some time before committing the offenses or being disturbed either 
 by a parent coming in, or the child waking up. He remained calm, even 
 when disturbed."</p>
        <p>Mystery</p>
        <p>Of the 12 offenses, there were four in Carvoeiro, six in the Vale da 
 Parra, Praia da Gale district, and two in Praia da Luz. On two occasions, 
 the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby.</p>
        <p>The man is said to have spoken in English with a foreign accent, and 
 his voice was described as slow, or possibly slurred.</p>
        <p>Last October, new police sketches were released of potential suspects 
 in the case, and UK police appeared in a television appeal for information.</p>
        <p>The program prompted a flurry of tips, and police in Portugal announced 
 they would reopen the case. Since then, the Portuguese investigation has 
 run in parallel with the British one.</p>
        <p>Detectives have previously said they were investigating a spike in break-ins 
 in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two of them in 
 the same block where her family was staying.</p>
        <p>Mystery has surrounded Madeleine's disappearance for the past six years. 
 Neither her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, nor the detectives investigating 
 her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, 
 England.</p>
