        <p>(CNN) -- One of China's controversial "baby hatches" has been 
 forced to shut down, at least temporarily. The facility in the southern 
 city of Guangzhou opened in January but has been overwhelmed with abandoned 
 infants, forcing a suspension of services.</p>
        <p>The first of the facilities opened in 2011 and increased to around 25 
 hatches countrywide. More of the special rooms, which are equipped with 
 a cradle, incubator and delayed alarm to allow mothers to drop off unwanted 
 babies anonymously, are planned. While abandoning infants in China is 
 illegal, the practice is relatively widespread, especially in poorer areas.</p>
        <p>The Guangzhou "baby safety island," as they are known in Chinese, 
 has received 262 babies since it began operation in late January, according 
 to Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua.</p>
        <p>All 262 babies suffer from disabilities or diseases such as cerebral 
 palsy, Down's syndrome and congenital heart disease according to Xinhua. 
 The scheme's proponents argue that the hatches are key to saving the lives 
 of children who would likely die if abandoned on the street.</p>
        <p>Since its opening, the facility received an average of around five babies 
 a day. The staggering number of infants who have been abandoned in the 
 city has meant that the hatch's operator has not been able to keep up 
 with the volume. The city's Welfare Center for Children has had to add 
 spaces to take their facilities to 1,100 beds, but these are already full.</p>
        <p>Xu Jiu the center's director told Xinhua that the Guangzhou baby hatch 
 had received a disproportionate number of infants.</p>
        <p>"The number of babies we have received is much higher than in other 
 parts of the country over the same period," he said.</p>
        <p>He added that it could be parents who are unable to cope with the heavy 
 economic burden of trying to treat incurable diseases.</p>
        <p>"Parents bring their ill babies to big cities in the hope of having 
 them cured. But many just end up abandoning them," he said</p>
        <p>He was not able to predict a date when normal service would resume, 
 but rather said that the center would focus on the children already in 
 their care.</p>
        <p>The unprecedented response to the facility's opening is causing some 
 to question the wisdom of the scheme. However, the government appears 
 to be standing by the hatches.</p>
        <p>Li Liguo, Minister of Civil Affairs, told reporters in the background 
 of the country's annual meeting of parliament this month that they "do 
 more good than harm."</p>
