        <p>Veteran journalist Tom Brokaw, former anchor for NBC Nightly News, made 
 headlines recently by announcing his diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a 
 relatively uncommon and incurable cancer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Veerpal Singh, a hematologist on staff at Advocate Sherman Hospital 
 in Elgin, Ill., says recent advancements in treatment options offer some 
 short term hope for those with the disease.</p>
        <p>“This type of cancer can be controlled very well with different types 
 of treatments,” Dr. Singh says. “We have made a lot of achievements in 
 innovative therapies that can help patients to go into remission for many 
 years. Unfortunately, multiple myeloma patients are always at risk of 
 relapse.”</p>
        <p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells in the 
 bone marrow. “Everyone has plasma cells that build up immunity to help 
 guard against infections and other diseases,” Dr. Singh says. “When these 
 plasma cells become cancerous, they can manifest into multiple plasma 
 disorders, including multiple myeloma.”</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Singh, approximately 22,500 people were diagnosed with 
 multiple myeloma in 2013. The median survival is three to five years, 
 although life expectancy varies on a case-by-case basis with some patients 
 living for many years after diagnosis, Dr. Singh notes. Age is also a 
 major factor, with most patients being diagnosed in their 60s and 70s. 
 Brokaw was 73 years old when diagnosed in August 2013.</p>
        <p>“The median age of diagnosis is 60 to 65, although we do see patients 
 who are younger,” Dr. Singh says. “Multiple myeloma is typically more 
 aggressive in younger people.”</p>
        <p>Multiple myeloma causes low blood count, which can lead to anemia (a 
 condition causing extreme weakness and fatigue). It can also wear away 
 bone, making myeloma patients more prone to fractures. It can also cause 
 high levels of calcium and even kidney failure.</p>
        <p>Treatment options have advanced in recent years and now include novel 
 chemotherapy treatments to target cancer cells directly. These therapies, 
 including thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide, do not have the traditional 
 chemotherapy side effects, Dr. Singh says. Another option is an autologous 
 stem cell transplant in which the patient’s own healthy stem cells are 
 collected and transplanted back into the body.</p>
        <p>“Whether newer therapies or autologous stem cell transplant, treatment 
 is determined by a patient’s risk factors and how aggressive the cancer 
 is,” Dr. Singh explains. “If a patient has a high risk of recurrence, 
 he or she is likely to be an ideal candidate for a transplant.”</p>
        <p>Brokaw is currently undergoing treatment and appears to be responding 
 well, according to news reports. “With innovative treatments now available, 
 this cancer can be controlled for a longer time, providing a higher quality 
 of life for patients,” Dr. Singh says.</p>
