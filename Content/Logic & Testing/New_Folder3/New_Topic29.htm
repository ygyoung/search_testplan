        <p>FreedomWorks backs incumbent members of Congress</p>

        <p>(CNN) - The political action committee for FreedomWorks, a grassroots 
 conservative group known for backing tea party challengers, released a 
 list Monday of incumbent lawmakers it's endorsing in this year's midterm 
 elections.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, the group backs third-term Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, 
 who doesn't have a Republican challenger.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>FreedomWorks also supports Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who was 
 appointed to the Senate at the end of 2012 and will run for a special 
 election this year to fill the remainder of former Sen. Jim DeMint's seat.</p>
        <p>The group endorses Sen. Jim Risch in Idaho, a first-term senator who 
 was elected with 65% support in the GOP primary in 2008, and with 58% 
 in the general election.</p>
        <p>Neither Risch or Scott are facing serious primary challengers.</p>
        <p>"FreedomWorks PAC is working hard to bring fresh talent to the 
 table, but it's also critical to protect the new generation of leadership 
 that has begun repopulating the Republican Party," Matt Kibbe, president 
 of FreedomWorks PAC, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>On the House side, FreedomWorks backs Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, 
 Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and Rep. 
 Ted Yoho of Florida–all of whom were first elected in 2012.</p>
        <p>It also supports Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona, who was first elected 
 to Congress from 1994-2000, and was re-elected in 2012. The group also 
 backs two congressmen who came to the House in the GOP wave of 2010: Rep. 
 Tom Graves of Georgia and Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Other names on its endorsement list includes Rep. Mark Sanford of South 
 Carolina, who was first elected to Congress from 1994 to 2000, then served 
 as governor from 2002 to 2010. He was elected to the House again in a 
 2013 special election. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, a conservative firebrand 
 who was elected in 2004, also made the list.</p>
