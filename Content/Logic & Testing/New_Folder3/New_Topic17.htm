        <p>(CNN) -- You may not have noticed it, but in the midst of all the usual 
 finger-pointing and polarization, a bit of actual problem-solving is underway 
 in American politics.</p>

            </a>A coalition of unlikely allies has coalesced in recent months to advance 
 criminal justice reform. These strange bedfellows -- from liberal Democrats 
 such as Sen. Dick Durbin to tea party darlings such as Sen. Mike Lee, 
 from the NAACP to Americans for Tax Reform -- are all proposing reductions 
 in mandatory minimum sentences.</p>

            </a>U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's calls for such reductions have been 
 cheered by some of the same Republicans who otherwise want to impeach 
 him. In Texas, a conservative group called Right on Crime has led the 
 way on prison and sentencing reform -- earning plaudits from, among others, 
 California progressives.</p>
        <p>Eric Liu</p>
        <p>Eric Liu</p>
        <p>Why this rash of consensus?</p>
        <p>Well, for the right, it's mainly about getting control of big government 
 -- prisons now consume a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, and 
 state prison spending has been on a multidecade boom with little corresponding 
 "return on investment."</p>
        <p>For the left, it's mainly about social justice -- the disparity in criminal 
 sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine has a long-documented racial 
 dimension, and blindly filling the "school-to-prison pipeline" 
 has seemed misguided and cruel.</p>
        <p>
            <a name="kanchor40">
            </a>Democrats and Republicans agree the metastasis of the prison-industrial 
 complex is unhealthy. But for each side there are also benefits to acknowledging 
 the other side's rationale. In a GOP sometimes perceived as intolerant, 
 Rand Paul's embrace of sentencing reform lets him to show his concern 
 for minorities. Civil rights Democrats, meanwhile, get to embrace fiscal 
 responsibility.</p>
        <p>The criminal justice deal-making suggests a possible way forward for 
 our politics: crosspartisanship. Crosspartisanship may look like bipartisanship, 
 but it's different.</p>
        <p>Bipartisan compromise typically splits the difference between the views 
 of two parties, giving each side less than its ideal outcome. A crosspartisan 
 approach, by contrast, finds issues where people from both parties converge 
 on a common principle, even if for different reasons, and achieve an outcome 
 that's ideal to both.</p>
        <p>&#160;Holder: 'Vicious cycle' traps too many</p>
        <p>Where else might such crosspartisanship take hold? Curbing government 
 surveillance is a possibility. Reducing crony capitalism is another. Even 
 reform of the federal tax code, an arena as full of political landmines 
 as crime and punishment used to be, might be feasible.</p>
        <p>On surveillance, Edward Snowden's revelations have scrambled party affiliations, 
 bringing civil libertarians from left and right together to push back 
 against the National Security Agency. Liberals hate the size of the national 
 security state because they are wary of war; conservatives hate it because 
 they are wary of government.</p>
        <p>
            <a name="kanchor41">
            </a>On crony capitalism, Republicans since 2008 have blamed the housing 
 and financial collapse on the profligate policies of quasigovernmental 
 agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Democrats have blamed 
 unregulated and predatory Wall Street firms. It's possible, of course, 
 that they're both substantially right.</p>
        <p>The moment is ripe for a liberal to say that government created the 
 conditions for corruption in housing finance, and for a conservative to 
 say that the absence of government accelerated such corruption. Perhaps 
 both sides can agree that when public policy allows businesses to privatize 
 gain while socializing loss, that's neither true capitalism nor good government.</p>
        <p>On taxes, GOP House member Dave Camp of Michigan recently put forward 
 a framework for tax reform that, while admittedly going nowhere legislatively, 
 did take aim at tax expenditures -- loopholes -- that disproportionately 
 benefit the privileged. He's not alone among conservatives, and they may 
 be able to join with liberals who see such tax expenditures as welfare 
 for the rich.</p>
        <p>I'm not suggesting by any means that we're about to enter some golden 
 age of collaboration in our politics. On plenty of issues -- making it 
 easier for unions to organize workers or cutting taxes on the rich -- 
 there are still irreconcilable policy differences that reflect deeper 
 differences in worldview.</p>
        <p>Some people, like me, think unions are generally a force for good; others 
 see them as inherently inefficient, even evil. Some people divide the 
 country into "makers" and "takers"; others find that 
 division and its implications repugnant.</p>
        <p>So the fighting will in most cases continue. But in the same way that 
 the United States in foreign policy can sometimes partner with adversaries 
 or rivals -- simply because it is in our interest in that moment to do 
 so -- perhaps in domestic politics we can foster more such pragmatism. 
 And make it contagious.</p>
        <p>If that's going to happen, though, it'll be up to us as citizens to 
 say that we want it. We'll have to reward elected leaders for this style 
 of crosspartisan problem-solving. We'll have to resist punishing them 
 for even talking to "the enemy." And then more leaders will 
 have to learn to think -- and lead -- outside the lines of party.</p>
