        <p>(CNN) – You may have never heard of Lavern Chatman, a Democrat running 
 for Congress in northern Virginia.</p>
        <p>But now that her pal Oprah Winfrey is making a rare political appearance 
 for the candidate, Chatman is making national headlines.</p>
        <p>It helps to have famous friends.</p>
        <p>Chatman announced Tuesday that Winfrey will appear at a fundraiser for 
 Chatman on April 5 in Arlington, Virginia. The event will be focused on 
 women's issues, Chatman said.</p>
        <p>"Oprah is a good friend and we both share a passion for empowering 
 women and girls for leadership. I'm delighted she is coming to town to 
 help with my congressional campaign," she said in a statement on 
 her website.</p>
        <p>She's one of nearly a dozen Democrats running in the solidly-Democratic 
 8th Congressional District, where longtime Rep. Jim Moran is retiring.</p>
        <p>"To win a race like this, you need a lot of support and a strong 
 grass roots effort. Our campaign is off to a tremendous start," she 
 said in the statement about Winfrey.</p>
        <p>Chatman has run nonprofit community-based programs, according to her 
 website, including a group that aims to boost voter participation and 
 a mentoring organization called The Grandfathers Group.</p>
        <p>While Winfrey started getting more involved in politics with then-Sen. 
 Barack Obama's first presidential campaign, she still largely stays out 
 of campaigns and elections. Other exceptions include former Newark mayor 
 Cory Booker, who ran for the Senate and won in a special election last 
 year with support from Winfrey. She also gave a check to a young city 
 council candidate in Stockton, California in 2012.</p>
        <p>She has donated to state Democratic parties, as well as the Democratic 
 National Committee.</p>
