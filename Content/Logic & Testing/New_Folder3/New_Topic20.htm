        <p>(CNN) -- Tesla Motors prides itself on promoting a disruptive technology 
 -- electric cars -- but it was Tesla itself that was disrupted recently 
 as New Jersey said it is illegal, effective April 1, to operate factory-direct 
 car sales in the state.</p>
        <p>New Jersey is not alone. Arizona, Maryland, Texas and Virginia also 
 ban direct sale of cars to consumers.</p>
        <p>Understandably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was upset and has encouraged people 
 in the Garden State to go to New York or Pennsylvania to buy Tesla cars.</p>

        <p>Many wonder whether Tesla has been out to turn the car-marketing world 
 on its head, do away with the franchised dealership system and change 
 forever the way people in the U.S. buy cars.</p>
        <p>It can seem that way as Tesla fights to keep selling its cars direct 
 to its customers, but missed in the speculative fervor is that Musk himself 
 has said that as it grows, Tesla probably would be looking at expanding 
 its presence -- and sales -- through franchised dealerships.</p>
        <p>Today, progressive dealerships around the country representing every 
 automaker are creating experiences that make car buying easier and deliver 
 a high level of customer satisfaction. Musk could cherry-pick dealers 
 who can deliver the experience he wants for his customers, just as Lexus 
 did when it launched its brand in the U.S. in 1989.</p>
        <p>Selling and servicing cars is an entirely different business from making 
 them. Using franchised dealerships relieves the car manufacturer of the 
 tremendous capital burden of paying for and staffing brick-and-mortar 
 facilities. That's one reason the auto industry went with that model in 
 the first place.</p>
        <p>Besides, car dealerships are important corporate citizens, pumping into 
 the national economy hundreds of millions of sales-tax dollars, tens of 
 millions of dollars in charitable contributions and billions of dollars 
 in paychecks. That makes them valuable economically. It also gives them 
 clout that few politicians want to challenge.</p>

 cars in Detroit On GPS, Musk talks about future of Tesla</p>
        <p>More importantly for car buyers and car owners, a national network of 
 franchised dealerships with local sales and service facilities can make 
 buying and caring for a new or used vehicle relatively easy.</p>
        <p>You can see why the idea might ultimately appeal to Tesla.</p>
        <p>Tesla -- as innovative, different and disruptive as it may be -- is 
 still a small player in a very large arena. It sold just under 25,000 
 cars last year globally. General Motors sold more than that every day. 
 If Tesla has an eye on significant growth, the traditional dealership 
 model, in its most progressive form, is a path the brand shouldn't ignore.</p>
        <p>Today, Tesla is arguing that it has no existing franchised dealers with 
 which its factory sales compete, and that it is selling something so unique 
 that an entirely different sales model is necessary at the beginning. 
 That won't always be the case.</p>
        <p>So far, Tesla's game plan to make its money purely on car sales. (Electric 
 cars bring in almost no service and maintenance income, which is lifeblood 
 to most car dealers.) There also is no bargaining at Tesla, where the 
 manufacturer's suggested retail price is the sales price, take it or leave 
 it.</p>
        <p>That works when your customer base is largely a high-income group of 
 "early adopters," you have no real competition for your $70,000-$120,000 
 vehicles, you don't take trade-ins and the profit per vehicle allows you 
 to pamper your customers with personalized services.</p>
        <p>That will change in a few years, though, when Tesla begins selling its 
 planned third-generation electric car, one priced to compete with the 
 likes of BMW's 3-Series. Reaching out to the mid-to-upper mass market 
 where there is a lot of competition for the consumer's attention -- and 
 dollars -- takes a different kind of approach. When Tesla scales to reach 
 that more mainstream audience, turning to a more traditional sales format 
 may indeed be necessary.</p>
        <p>Until then, the company has a high-profile battle on its hands. The 
 courts, and the market, will decide the merits of Tesla's arguments. Even 
 if Tesla were to prevail on the legal front in every case and win the 
 right to continue selling direct to car shoppers in every state, that 
 decision would hardly override the existing franchise protection laws 
 and the value that locally owned and operated dealerships can bring to 
 the equation.</p>
