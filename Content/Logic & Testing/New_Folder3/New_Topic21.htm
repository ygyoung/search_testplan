            <MadCap:concept term="search" />Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a director 
 at the New America Foundation and the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year 
 Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad."</p>
        <p>(CNN) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters over the 
 weekend that "deliberate" action by somebody on board accounted 
 for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 veering off course.</p>
        <p>Could the mystery of Malaysia Airlines 370 then be explained as an act 
 of terrorism?</p>
        <p>To answer that you have to assess both the capabilities and the intentions 
 of the known terrorist groups that might want to hijack such a plane. 
 And you have to ask the question: Cui bono? For whose benefit?</p>

        <p>The al Qaeda-affiliated group, Jemaah Islamiyah, has a presence in Malaysia 
 as well as in the Philippines and Indonesia. But the group has been under 
 sustained law enforcement pressure for more than a decade after it bombed 
 nightclubs on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002, killing more than 
 200 people, mostly Western tourists. The group has also carried out bombings 
 at the Australian Embassy in Indonesia and the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton 
 Hotels in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.</p>
        <p>However, the capabilities of the once-potent Jemaah Islamiyah have eroded 
 over time. And would Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamist militant group, target 
 for attack the air carrier of a majority Muslim country on which quite 
 a number of Muslims were likely traveling? It is more plausible that the 
 group would select a Western airline because Western embassies and Western 
 brand-name hotels have been the focus of their previous attacks and plots.</p>
        <p>A terrorist group that might have a motive is the East Turkestan Islamic 
 Movement, a separatist group in China founded by Uyghurs that has had 
 some historical ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Uyghurs are an ethnic 
 group in western China who are Muslim. The group has conducted a number 
 of terrorist attacks in China.</p>

 drama' Missing jet spawns conspiracy theories</p>
        <p>Uyghur terrorists might have a motive to hijack the Malaysia Airlines 
 flight as it was bound for Beijing and most of the passengers were Chinese. 
 But Uyghur militants have operated almost exclusively inside China. And 
 when they have tried to mount hijackings in the past they have been complete 
 flops. On March 9, 2008, a 19-year old Uyghur woman attempted to set off 
 some kind of explosive device on a flight from the Xinjiang Uyghur region 
 en route to Beijing. The flight crew detained the woman before she could 
 detonate the device.</p>
        <p>Four year later, on June 29, 2012, half a dozen Uyghur men attempted 
 to take control of an aircraft flying in the Xinjiang Uyghur region using 
 pieces of a metal crutch that had been sharpened to make crude weapons. 
 This plot was also foiled.</p>
        <p>Bolstering the view that Uyghur terrorists did not hijack the Malaysia 
 Airlines flight, on Tuesday a Chinese official said that background checks 
 on the passengers on the plane produced no evidence that any of the Chinese 
 citizens on board were involved in terrorism.</p>
        <p>Beyond Uyghur militants or operatives of Jemaah Islamiyah, might there 
 be other terrorist groups with the motivation and capability of pulling 
 off the hijacking of the Malaysia Airlines flight?</p>
        <p>It doesn't seem so. If this were a hijacking for political purposes, 
 the hijacking would have been followed by an act designed to send a political 
 message, such as the planes hijacked on 9/11 that were then flown into 
 the World Trade Center and Pentagon.</p>
        <p>Or there would be set of demands, as was the case with the Indian Airlines 
 flight that was hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan, by militant Kashmiri 
 separatists in December 1999. They demanded the release of leading militants 
 in Indian jails, a demand to which the Indian government acceded.</p>
        <p>Or there would be a credible claim of responsibility. The one claim 
 of responsibility so far is from an outfit calling itself the Chinese 
 Martyrs' Brigade. This claim is not deemed to be credible. Malaysian Transport 
 Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters last week: "There 
 is no sound or credible grounds to justify their claims.'"</p>
        <p>If the diversion of Malaysia Airlines 370 was not an act of terrorism, 
 the other likely scenarios are a pilot suicide attempt, the piracy of 
 the plane for some kind of economic reason or the commandeering of the 
 aircraft by someone with an idiosyncratic motive that will only become 
 clear over time.</p>
