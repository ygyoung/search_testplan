        <p>On anniversary of GOP 'autopsy,' both sides take aim</p>
        <p>Posted by</p>
        <p>CNN's Dana Davidsen</p>
        <p>(CNN) - It's probably not on your calendar but in the political world 
 Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of a symbolically important, self-determined 
 revamp for the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>As Republicans march on to the 2014 midterms armed with a plan for success 
 - laid out in a post-election report prescribed from the party's failing 
 in the 2012 - Democrats insist the so-called autopsy has had a negligible 
 effect on transforming the GOP.</p>
        <p>Republicans regroup</p>
        <p>Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman who ordered 
 the report, termed the "Growth and Opportunity Project Effort," 
 said one year later, "I can report that we've fundamentally reshaped 
 the way we do business."</p>
        <p>The effort focused on assessing and improving the GOP's campaign strategy 
 - including ground game and fundraising. It looked at learning lessons 
 from Democrats' successful campaign methods, which helped secure President 
 Barack Obama's second term and propelled the party to a net gain of two 
 seats in the U.S. Senate and eight seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>In an opinion editorial for CNN, Priebus touted his party's multi-million 
 dollar investment in technology - and area where Democrats in recent elections 
 have surged ahead - and new voter outreach efforts. Priebus writes that 
 the RNC is even venturing into Silicon Valley for data tool development 
 for field organizers.</p>
        <p>More tangibly, the party has moved to overhaul the Republican presidential 
 election process for 2016, by condensing the primary calendar and punishing 
 states that upend voting order. They are also considering moving the GOP 
 nominating convention to late June instead of late August, when it was 
 held in 2012, and limit the number of Republican presidential primary 
 debates.</p>
        <p>One year older... but wiser?</p>
        <p>"Three hundred-sixty five days later, all the Republican Party 
 is is another year older," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair 
 of the rival Democratic National Committee, said at press conference in 
 Washington.</p>
        <p>The congresswoman from Florida said Republicans have failed to change 
 their tone towards groups like woman and minorities - blocs that heavily 
 favored Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.</p>
        <p>Asked if Democrats are banking on outlandish comments from Republicans 
 in future elections, Schultz pointed to her party's 2013 win in purple 
 state of Virginia, where Democrats now control the offices of Governor, 
 Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General.</p>
        <p>"We didn't win elections in the last couple cycles on Hail Marys," 
 she said.</p>
        <p>Spinning FL-13</p>
        <p>In gearing up for the 2014 elections, a special Congressional race in 
 Florida last week gave Republicans a boost of confidence heading into 
 the midterms.</p>
        <p>GOP candidate and former Washington lobbyist David Jolly beat out Democrat 
 Alex Sink in the election to fill a seat left vacant by the death last 
 October of longtime Republican Rep. Bill Young.</p>
        <p>While the outcome does not change anything for Democrats in their calculus 
 for retaking the House in next November's midterms - they still need to 
 pick up 17 seats - the race was seen as testing the waters for the coming 
 election.</p>
        <p>"The power of our new tools and new strategy was on display last 
 week, when we helped David Jolly win an important special election in 
 Florida's 13th Congressional District. That victory has Democrats worried 
 about November," Priebus said in the op-ed.</p>
        <p>RNC chairman predicts 'tsunami-type election'</p>
        <p>When asked about the results, Wasserman Schultz said Democrats would 
 have liked a win but warned that insight into which party will succeed 
 in the midterms won't come from a special election.</p>
        <p>"The reality is that was a special election where the Republicans 
 won in a Republican district," she said. "We know that when 
 Democrats vote, Democrats win so turnout in terms of what the electorate 
 looks like is really critical."</p>
