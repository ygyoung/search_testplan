        <p>(CNN) -- Western powers slapped sanctions on more than two dozen Russian 
 officials and their allies in Ukraine's Crimea region on Monday, while 
 Ukrainian officials vowed they would never accept the territory's annexation 
 by Russia.</p>
        <p>In a televised address Monday night, interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr 
 Turchynov said his government would do "everything possible" 
 to solve the crisis diplomatically, and he praised his citizens for refusing 
 to respond to Russian provocations with violence.</p>
        <p>"The Kremlin is afraid of the democratic future which we are building, 
 and this is the reason for their aggression," Turchynov said. "But 
 this will not be an obstacle to the building of a democratic country."</p>
        <p>But he announced a partial mobilization of his country's armed forces 
 and said Ukrainians "have to unite in one big family, which is ready 
 to protect its home." Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there 
 was "a strong possibility" of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>&#160;Obama: Diplomacy possible in Ukraine Vote like 'slowly unfolding 
 bad movie' Russia: Crimea vote was legal Mixed feelings after Crimean 
 referendum The mood is grim in Kiev Square</p>
        <p>"I still believe that there is only one solution of this crisis, 
 a peaceful one," Yatsenyuk said. "But we offer peace, and Russia 
 offers war."</p>
        <p>The Russian-backed breakaway government in Crimea applied to join with 
 Moscow on Monday after a weekend referendum that Ukraine, the United States 
 and the European Union called illegal. U.S. and EU officials announced 
 sanctions on more than two dozen Russian officials and their allies in 
 the region, which Russian-backed forces seized three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that recognizes 
 the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Crimea, says a statement 
 on Russia's Kremlin website. The Russian parliament is expected to vote 
 on whether to annex the breakaway territory in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Turchynov said Ukraine was willing to hold talks with Russia, "but 
 we will never accept the annexing of our territory."</p>
        <p>The EU sanctions include the top pro-Russian Crimean secessionist leaders, 
 10 leading Russian lawmakers who have endorsed the annexation of Crimea 
 and three top Russian military commanders. The U.S. sanctions list also 
 includes two top advisers to Russian President Vladimir Putin and ex-Ukrainian 
 President Yanukovych, whose February ouster in the face of widespread 
 anti-government protests sparked the current crisis.</p>
        <p>In Washington, President Barack Obama warned Moscow: "Further provocations 
 will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its 
 place in the world."</p>
        <p>"The international community will continue to stand together to 
 oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
 and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen 
 Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy," 
 he said.</p>
        <p>Russian official: Proud to be sanctioned</p>
        <p>Washington said its sanctions targeted Russian officials and lawmakers, 
 as well as Crimea-based separatist leaders, with financial sanctions for 
 undermining "democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine." 
 Obama's order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel 
 for the 11 people named. Among those sanctioned were ousted Ukrainian 
 President Viktor Yanukovych and aides to Putin.</p>
        <p>But one of the Putin aides named in the U.S. sanctions called it "a 
 great honor" to be singled out for American punishment.</p>
        <p>"I consider the decision of the Washington administration as a 
 recognition of my service to Russia," Vladislav Surkov told Russian 
 news outlet MK.</p>
        <p>And in Brussels, Belgium, European Union international policy chief 
 Catherine Ashton announced sanctions against 21 people "responsible 
 for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty 
 and independence of Ukraine." She called the weekend vote "illegal" 
 and "a clear breach of the Ukrainian Constitution," and she 
 urged Russia not to follow up by annexing the territory.</p>
        <p>"We want to underline very clearly that there is still time to 
 avoid a negative spiral and to reverse current developments," she 
 said.</p>
        <p>More measures are expected to follow in a few days, when EU leaders 
 meet for a summit in Brussels, Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Linas 
 Linkevicius wrote in a message on Twitter.</p>
        <p>Diplomatically, Sunday's referendum has put the United States and Russia 
 on the kind of collision course not seen since the Cold War. Economically, 
 it's unclear how much such a coupling will cost Russia.</p>
        <p>"These are pinpricks," Russian journalist and CNN analyst 
 Vladimir Pozner said of Monday's sanctions. Some officials won't be able 
 to travel to the United States, but they "probably won't lose a lot 
 of sleep over it," he told CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper."</p>
        <p>But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said the sanctions will show Putin 
 that if Russia annexes Crimea, "This is just the beginning of sanctions, 
 not the end."</p>

 Crimea and Ukraine, captured by CNN teams</p>
        <p>Crimea is home to 2 million people, most of them ethnic Russian. Moscow 
 strongly backed Sunday's referendum, which the region's leaders declared 
 won with an overwhelming 96.7% vote in favor of leaving Ukraine. Russian 
 lawmakers have said they will welcome Crimea with open arms, but members 
 of the ethnic Ukrainian and Muslim Tatar minorities had said they would 
 boycott the vote.</p>
        <p>Many Crimeans hope the union with Russia will bring better pay and make 
 them citizens of a country capable of asserting itself on the world stage. 
 Others saw the referendum as a land grab by the Kremlin from Ukraine, 
 whose new rulers want to move the country toward the European Union and 
 away from Moscow's sway.</p>
        <p>Yatsenyuk said Moscow appeared ready to attempt a similar play in other 
 Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, starting with demonstrations by what 
 he called "political tourists" with foreign passports.</p>
        <p>"Look (at) the last rallies that happened in Donetsk and in Kharkiv 
 and in Lugansk," he said. "They gathered from 500 people up 
 to 4,000 people. But they expected to have 50,000 people. So we talked 
 to the people. We tried to address this issue in the right manner, trying 
 to convince Ukrainians that the biggest asset we have is our country."</p>
        <p>Earlier, Yatsenyuk threatened dire consequences for the Crimean politicians 
 who had called the vote, threatening to try them in Ukrainian and international 
 courts.</p>
        <p>Andrii Parubii, the secretary of the Ukrainian parliament's National 
 Security and Defense Council, told lawmakers the protesters included "elite 
 special units that are trying to arrive to Ukraine with weapons, and that 
 are trying to implement a joint plan of the same scenario that was conducted 
 in Crimea."</p>
        <p>Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh reported Sunday that Ukrainian troops 
 and equipment are being moved to the east and south after a weekend Russian 
 incursion into the town of Strilkove, northeast of Crimea. About 60 Russian 
 troops took part in the operation, which the Russians said was needed 
 to prevent a possible terrorist attack on oil assets, according to Ukrainian 
 border guards.</p>
        <p>The area supplies electricity, fresh water and natural gas to the Crimean 
 Peninsula.</p>
        <p>What happens next</p>
        <p>• On Monday, Russia proposed creating an international support group 
 to mediate in the Ukraine crisis. Its Foreign Ministry said in a statement 
 that this group would urge Ukraine to implement portions of a February 
 21 peace deal and formulate a new constitution that would include Russian 
 as an official language alongside Ukrainian, as well as set out broad 
 powers for the country's regions.</p>
        <p>• Putin will address a joint session of Russia's parliament to speak 
 about Crimea on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>• Russian lawmakers say they will discuss the future of Crimea on Friday. 
 "All the necessary legislative decisions on the results of the referendum 
 will be taken as soon as possible," said Sergey Neverov, the deputy 
 speaker of the lower house of parliament, the Duma. "The referendum 
 shows that the people of Crimea see their future as a part of Russia."</p>
        <p>• Crimean lawmakers have approved legislation to make the Russian ruble 
 the official currency in Crimea alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia, according 
 to a statement posted on the Crimean Parliament's website. The hryvnia 
 remains an official currency until January 1, 2016. The statement did 
 not provide a date for when the ruble would be circulated in the region.</p>
        <p>• The lawmakers also adopted a resolution stating that on March 30, 
 Crimea will move to Moscow Standard Time.</p>
        <p>• A secession would mean transferring banks, public utilities and public 
 transport from Ukraine to Russia in what would undoubtedly be a costly 
 operation. Crimea is entirely integrated into Ukraine's mainland economy 
 and infrastructure: Ninety percent of its water, 80% of its electricity 
 and roughly 65% of its gas comes from the rest of country. It also depends 
 heavily on the Ukrainian mainland to balance its books. About 70% of Crimea's 
 $1.2 billion budget comes directly from Kiev.</p>
        <p>• A special tax system may be introduced for Crimea, Russia's state-run 
 ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday, citing Russian Finance Minister 
 Sergei Shatalov.</p>
