        <p>Romney slams Obama, Clinton for foreign policy 'failure'</p>

        <p>(CNN) - Mitt Romney is blaming President Barack Obama and former Secretary 
 of State Hillary Clinton for the crisis in Ukraine as well as other foreign 
 policy challenges across the globe.</p>
        <p>In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the former Massachusetts governor 
 and 2012 Republican presidential nominee says a "failure" by 
 the President and former secretary of state to lead when they had the 
 chance has led to the current situation.</p>
        <p>Romney's op-ed comes on the same day that Russian President Vladimir 
 Putin signed a treaty making Crimea part of Russia after the autonomous 
 region of Ukraine voted overwhelming this past weekend to join Russia. 
 The United States, the European Union, and Ukraine did not recognize the 
 results of the referendum.</p>
        <p>"From Crimea to North Korea, from Syria to Egypt, and from Iraq 
 to Afghanistan, America apparently has no good options. If possession 
 is nine-tenths of the law, Russia owns Crimea and all we can do is sanction 
 and disinvite-and wring our hands," Romney wrote.</p>
        <p>And Romney placed the blame on Obama and Clinton, who if she runs for 
 the White House in 2016 would instantly become the overwhelming favorite 
 to win the Democratic nomination.</p>
        <p>"President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton traveled the world 
 in pursuit of their promise to reset relations and to build friendships 
 across the globe. Their failure has been painfully evident: It is hard 
 to name even a single country that has more respect and admiration for 
 America today than when President Obama took office, and now Russia is 
 in Ukraine. Part of their failure, I submit, is due to their failure to 
 act when action was possible, and needed," Romney wrote.</p>
        <p>Romney was derided for saying during the 2012 election that Russia was 
 a major political foe of the U.S. In a March 2012 interview with CNN's 
 Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room," Romney said that Russia 
 "without question, our number one geopolitical foe. They - they fight 
 every cause for the world's worst actors."</p>
        <p>But as the situation in Ukraine, and especially Crimea, unraveled over 
 the past month, many conservative commentators criticized the President 
 and touted Romney's prescience.</p>
        <p>Romney closed his op-ed by adding that there was still a chance for 
 American diplomacy, saying that a "chastened president and Secretary 
 of State Kerry, a year into his job, can yet succeed, and for the country’s 
 sake, must succeed. Timing is of the essence."</p>
        <p>Ron Paul: 'What's the big deal'</p>
        <p>Former longtime Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who ran for the 2008 and 2012 
 GOP presidential nominations, had a very different view of the crisis 
 in a piece published Tuesday in USA Today, asking, "What's the big 
 deal?" and "Why does the U.S. care which flag will be hoisted 
 on a small piece of land thousands of miles away?"</p>
        <p>Paul, who advocated an extremely limited U.S. foreign policy extremely 
 popular with his libertarian following, also wrote that "Perhaps 
 the U.S. officials who supported the unconstitutional overthrow of Ukraine's 
 government should refocus their energies on learning our own Constitution, 
 which does not allow the U.S. government to overthrow governments overseas 
 or send a billion dollars to bail out Ukraine and its international creditors."</p>
