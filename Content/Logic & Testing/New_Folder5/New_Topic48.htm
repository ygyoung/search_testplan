        <p>Platfora, a big data analytics company, raises $38 million</p>

        <p>CEO Ben Werther asks: Who needs a gut feeling in business when you've 
 got the facts?</p>
        <p>Platfora says it can analyze all of a company's data to help executives 
 make better decisions.</p>
        <p>Platfora says it can analyze all of a company's data to help executives 
 make better decisions.</p>
        <p>FORTUNE -- The big data startup Platfora announced on Wednesday that 
 it raised $38 million in a series C round led by Tenaya Capital.</p>
        <p>The round also included Citi Ventures, Cisco, Allegis Capital, Andreessen 
 Horowitz, Battery Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and In-Q-Tel and increases 
 the San Mateo, Calif.-based company's total financing to $65 million.</p>
        <p>Ben Werther, the company's chief executive, says he is trying to take 
 advantage of the increasing popularity of Apache Hadoop, the open source 
 database that gives businesses the flexibility to store data without deciding 
 its structure ahead of time and the ability to do so inexpensively. Hadoop 
 allows companies to store and manipulate all of their data, instead of 
 merely sample it; Werther's company promises to layer its analytics platform 
 over that infrastructure to allow line-of-business leaders, rather than 
 a company's IT department, find correlations that could help them make 
 better decisions about their customers.</p>

        <p>"It's Moneyball," Battery Ventures principal Mike Dauber said. 
 "In Moneyball, it turned out that everyone in baseball was wrong 
 -- they didn't understand the value in a run; they didn't understand the 
 value of a walk. Sometimes what we know about our world actually proves 
 out not to be true at all. There's a notion that 95% of business that 
 we see are going with their gut. These businesses will have to become 
 fact-based businesses or they'll go out of business. It sounds hyperbolic, 
 but it's true. Baseball teams who couldn't understand sabermetrics couldn't 
 compete."</p>
        <p>With the new funds, Werther says he'll be investing across all areas 
 of Platfora's business: Talent, technology, product, sales. The company's 
 analytics platform is offered as a subscription service on premises or 
 in the cloud, and its customers include Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS), 
 Edmunds.com, The Washington Post, Citi (C), and Vivint.</p>
        <p>"Businesses that are drowning in data and know there's insight 
 in there and just can't get to it -- there's no tooling built for them," 
 Dauber added. "Hadoop is so much cheaper than a Teradata. You can 
 actually store all of [the data]. Ten years from now, no one's going to 
 be talking about big data. It'll just be data. When you look at all the 
 data, how do you predictively get insights out of it? That's what got 
 me excited about Platfora. I think it has the chance to be sabermetrics 
 for everybody."</p>
