        <p>The CNNMoney Tech 30 index measures the performance of 30 major technology 
 stocks around the world.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Meet the CNNMoney Tech 30: an index of the most important tech stocks.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Tech 30 is to give CNNMoney readers a daily look at 
 how shares of the most influential technology companies are faring.</p>
        <p>The editors and writers of CNNMoney's technology team picked the 30 
 companies. To qualify, the stocks had to have shares publicly traded in 
 the United States that are easy for the average investor to buy. (Sorry, 
 Samsung!)</p>
        <p>The Tech 30 is a mix of the industry's giants, such as Amazon (AMZN, 
 Fortune 500), Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500), Cisco (CSCO, Fortune 500), Facebook 
 (FB, Fortune 500), Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) and Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 
 500).</p>
        <p>But we also included Chinese tech titans Baidu (BIDU) and Sina (SINA), 
 European heavyweights SAP (SAP) and ARM Holdings (ARMH) and leaders in 
 more specialized industries such as video game companies Activision Blizzard 
 (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA), security firm Symantec (SYMC, Fortune 
 500) and online travel king Priceline (PCLN, Fortune 500).</p>
        <p>Check out the entire CNNMoney Tech 30 portfolio</p>
        <p>The pure-tech focus differs from other tech stock barometers. The Nasdaq, 
 for example, is often cited as a "tech index" but only 42% of 
 the composite is made up of tech companies. The S&amp;P 500 Information 
 Technology index includes several stocks that aren't typically considered 
 at the cutting edge of tech, such as MasterCard (MA, Fortune 500), money 
 transfer service Western Union (WU, Fortune 500) and consulting firm Accenture 
 (ACN).</p>
        <p>To track the performance of the Tech 30 index, we "invested" 
 $1,000 in play money in each of the 30 stocks on January 2, 2014. So the 
 baseline for the index is $30,000.</p>
        <p>The CNNMoney Tech 30 portfolio page displays values for both the index 
 as a whole and the specific stocks. The graphic at the top of the page 
 measures the stocks' performance relative to one another from the beginning 
 of the year. The bubbles for the better-performing stocks will appear 
 larger.</p>
        <p>We don't plan to make regular changes to the Tech 30. But if a current 
 Tech 30 company is acquired or goes private, we'll replace it by "investing" 
 in a different stock.</p>
        <p>We may also choose to add shares of newly public companies when appropriate. 
 Twitter (TWTR), for example, was not on our original list when we first 
 started thinking about creating the index last summer. But we knew we 
 had to add Twitter to the Tech 30 once it filed for its initial public 
 offering.</p>
        <p>We'll include the Tech 30's performance in our daily market writes as 
 well as in stories from our investing and technology writers about these 
 30 companies.</p>
        <p>Check out the CNNMoney Tech 30 here. &#160;To top of page</p>
