        <p>Ad agency R/GA launches venture capital arm</p>
        <p>By Erin Griffith &#160;March 19, 2014: 6:36 AM ET</p>
        <p>Ad agency hopes to increase its cool factor by backing innovative startups.</p>
        <p>The Hammerhead bike navigation device.</p>
        <p>The Hammerhead bike navigation device, one of the R/GA connected device 
 accelerator's startups.</p>
        <p>FORTUNE -- Ad agency R/GA is in the process of launching a fund to invest 
 in startups, the agency's COO Stephen Plumlee said last night, during 
 a demo day for R/GA and Techstars' Connected Device accelerator.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Plumlee said the size of the fund can't yet be announced 
 as it is not yet closed. The fund will include capital from R/GA's parent 
 company, ad holding company IPG, (IPG), as well as from outside investors. 
 It would includes fund future accelerator classes of ten companies, which 
 each receive a convertible note worth up to $120,000 from R/GA.</p>
        <p>The fund, run by Plumlee, will give R/GA the opportunity to do follow-on 
 deals when appropriate and invest in a small handful of startups unrelated 
 to the accelerator program. R/GA already done three such deals from the 
 fund, which have not yet been announced.</p>
        <p>R/GA isn't the first ad agency to be lured into the venture capital 
 game. The trend started a few years ago, as I wrote in 2011:</p>
        <p>There's the recently launched Rockfish Brand Ventures and Redscout Ventures. 
 Consigliere, started last year by former Deutsch Inc. chief strategy officer 
 Mike Duda and Phoenix Suns star Steve Nash, is marketing a $20 million 
 fund. Last month Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal + Partners launched KBS+P Ventures. 
 Bartle Bogle Hegarty is raising $16 million through its newly formed Black 
 Sheep Fund. And Method Inc. is rounding up $30 million for Method Ventures.</p>
        <p>(Notably Black Sheep fund has been quiet since Publicis announced it 
 would acquire BBH in 2012. Mike Duda of Consigliere has since taken a 
 full-time role as CEO of Johannes Leonardo. Darren Herman of KPS+B has 
 taken a new role at the Mozilla Project. And it's not clear whether or 
 not Method Ventures ever closed its fund.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, holding company WPP has remained an active investor, backing 
 ad-tech startups like Buddy Media, Facebook (FB), Say Media, Jumptap and 
 Omniture. After it acquired creative agency AKQA, the holding company 
 formalized its venture arm, investing most recently in strategic deals 
 for Fullscreen, Muzy and Percolate .</p>

        <p>Agency-style investments aren't really motivated by money the same way 
 pure play venture capital firms are. Sure, it would be nice to mint a 
 return on the deals (which WPP certainly did with Buddy Media's $745 sale 
 to Salesforce). But even more valuable is the intrinsic feeling of being 
 innovative by working with startups. It provides a "cool factor" 
 for an agency's employees and clients.</p>
        <p>That cool factor is why R/GA won't seek out ad-tech deals like some 
 of its agency-investor peers have. Rather, it will invest in startups 
 that have little to do with advertising, Plumlee says. R/GA itself has 
 built products like the Nike Fuelband, and the agency's 1300 employees 
 include some 200 programmers, 200 visual designers and 100 UX designers.</p>
        <p>The sweet nectar of "innovation" is attractive to any big 
 corporation, so R/GA's new startup family can share its learnings with 
 clients like Nike (NKE), Beats Electronics, Samsung, Capital One and L'Oreal. 
 Likewise, those clients might be able to help the startups. At the demo 
 day, several R/GA clients, including Mastercard (MA) and Equinox, showed 
 up in the pitch decks of startup presentations as early customers or partners.</p>
