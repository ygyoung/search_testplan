        <p>Make $1000′s Per Day with Penny Stocks?</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>How many times have you wished you could have invested in some of today’s 
 biggest stocks back when they were available for pennies on the dollar?</p>
        <p>The majority of Americans today find it almost impossible to invest 
 in stock in their favorite companies because they simply cost too much 
 money. For example, Google currently trades at $780 per share and Apple 
 is at $422 per share.</p>
        <p>This has left small and first-time investors looking for fresh new investments 
 that have the potential to reap huge rewards very quickly. And that’s 
 exactly where penny stocks come in – offering you the opportunity to get 
 in on the ground floor.</p>
        <p>How It Works</p>
        <p>When exciting new companies go public , they make shares available to 
 average Americans for less than a dollar. These shares are called “penny 
 stocks”. These have recently become very popular because small investors 
 can easily afford to buy them. They are regulated by the SEC and other 
 US authorities and are traded on the “over-the-counter” markets as opposed 
 to the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>There are extremely good reasons to consider investing in penny stocks, 
 but here are the 3 most important:</p>
        <p>1. They don’t cost a lot of money </p>
        <p>For the same price as one share in a company like Apple or Google, you 
 have the power to buy thousands of shares . For example, if a technology 
 company is selling shares at 10 cents and you make $500 investment, you 
 can own 5,000 shares. If the stock rises to just $1.00, your investment 
 will turn into $5,000.</p>
        <p>2. Massive Returns in Sometimes Hours</p>
        <p>Providing you are subscribed to the right newsletter, you can uncover 
 penny stocks that are just about to explode. It’s not uncommon for penny 
 stocks to double and even triple over 24 hours, while most stocks on the 
 NYSE take years to mature.</p>
        <p>3. Easy to Buy</p>
        <p>Penny stocks are traded the same as major stocks. All you need is to 
 establish an online trading account like Etrade to buy them or you can 
 use a traditional broker to place your trades.</p>
        <p>Follow these two steps to get started immediately:</p>
        <p>As you’re probably aware, any stock has a certain degree of risk that 
 comes along with it. That’s why we’ve outlined the two most important 
 steps below.</p>
