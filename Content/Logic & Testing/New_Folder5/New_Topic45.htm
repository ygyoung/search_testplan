        <p>Bitcoin hedge fund launches with Silicon Valley and Wall St. support</p>
        <p>By Dan Primack &#160;March 18, 2014: 11:00 PM ET</p>
        <p>Pantera Capital forms Bitcoin fund, with the support of Fortress and 
 Silicon Valley VCs.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin</p>
        <p>Bitcoin</p>
        <p>FORTUNE -- Last December, I wrote that Fortress Investment Group was 
 preparing to launch a fund that would buy and hold Bitcoin. I also wrote 
 that while details were scarce," there was "some relationship 
 to a new Bitcoin-related fund raised by Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based 
 hedge fund whose clients are known to include several Fortress executives."</p>
        <p>Here is what I now know: Fortress has invested directly in Pantera Bitcoin 
 Partners, the limited liability company overseeing Pantera's Bitcoin fund. 
 Moreover, all future purchases of Bitcoin or other crytpocurrencies by 
 Fortress and its principals will be made via Pantera. In other words, 
 there will not be a Fortress-branded fund. It remains unclear if my initial 
 report was accurate and things changed, or if I was off track from the 
 beginning.</p>
        <p>One of the bread crumbs I apparently misread involved Steve Waterhouse, 
 whose LinkedIn profile at the time listed him as both a managing director 
 with Fortress and partner on an unnamed Bitcoin fund. Waterhouse has now 
 formally left Fortress, to become a partner with Pantera.</p>
        <p>In addition to Fortress, Pantera has received investments from venture 
 capital firms Benchmark and Ribbit Captial. Those three firms also recently 
 partnered to invest $20 million into Bitcoin "vault" company 
 Xapo, which happens to hold Pantera Bitcoin Fund's assets (Pantera also 
 made a small co-investment on that deal, which had not been previously 
 disclosed).</p>
        <p>No word yet on how much any of the three funds have invested in Pantera, 
 or how much Bitcoin they already have committed to the underlying hedge 
 fund (which is open-ended). In fact, all we really know about the hedge 
 fund is that it's more focused on long-term appreciation than active "trading," 
 and that it had $147 million in gross asset value as of last December 
 4 (according to a regulatory filing). A source familiar with the fund 
 said that at least some of the $147 million came from Fortress.</p>

        <p>"About a year ago I put all of my professional intentions into 
 Bitcoin, and came across these three firms and saw that we had similar 
 visions," explains Pantera CEO Dan Morehead, who originally launched 
 the firm to manage global macro hedge funds (something it no longer does 
 for outside investors). "Now they are shareholders."</p>
        <p>Ribbit Capital founder Micky Malka adds that the involvement of Pantera 
 and Fortress gives Bitcoin some Wall Street credibility, which could help 
 the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. "For Bitcoin to become stored value, 
 it needs to be trusted by hundreds of millions of people, not just hundreds 
 of thousands of people. It's still very high risk, but this is a step 
 toward that goal."</p>
