            <MadCap:concept term="search" />Shareholder research firms are not the enemy</p>
        <p>By Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of The Value Alliance &#160;March 19, 2014:

        <p>Insight Ventures or any purchaser of ISS will need to address the lack 
 of education and outright misinformation about proxy research firms.</p>
        <p>FORTUNE -- Very few things are as unyielding as an undeserved reputation.</p>
        <p>That truism goes for people and organizations -- and it has applied 
 to a number of firms that provide research on the matters shareholders 
 vote on. Why should you care? Because the research provided by these firms 
 helps inform the votes that mutual funds and pension funds exercise on 
 your behalf. And that research helps these institutions make better voting 
 decisions.</p>
        <p>Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Insight Ventures might 
 acquire one of those research providers, Institutional Shareholder Services 
 (ISS), which is currently owned by publicly traded MSCI (MSCI). In the 
 fourth quarter of 2013, MSCI said it had "engaged Morgan Stanley 
 to explore strategic alternatives for the Governance business, including 
 the potential divestiture or other separation of the entire business."</p>
        <p>Prior to the Insight Ventures speculation, The Financial Times last 
 year suggested Broadridge might buy the research firm. Broadridge already 
 controls a lion's share of the paperwork shuffling for small shareholders 
 like you and me -- and its actions have caused a great deal of concern 
 among institutional shareholders, as I described here last month. A purchase 
 of ISS by Broadridge might not only be dire for shareholder democracy, 
 it could be bad for part of ISS' business, as large shareholder customers, 
 distrustful of Broadridge, might flee.</p>

        <p>Insight Ventures or any purchaser of ISS will need to address the lack 
 of education and outright misinformation about ISS and the other proxy 
 research firms that compete and complement ISS' business. If a buyer could 
 bring the muscle of an educational campaign, ISS' management might find 
 itself with more time to devote to the business of research itself.</p>
        <p>Around the country, board members of publicly traded companies take 
 an avid interest in ISS. Some are appreciative of the work ISS does. And 
 they speak up to say so. ISS makes us think more deeply about what corporations 
 are doing, these directors say.</p>
        <p>But a dislike for these research firms coupled with misinformation is 
 out there too. I encountered this issue in early December. A board member 
 had just been to a conference where ISS was one of the topics for discussion. 
 "I just don't like the way ISS operates," the board member said. 
 "When it provides voting advice, it's one size fits all," the 
 director said.</p>
        <p>This is a popular misconception -- and at that moment, I had to decide 
 whether this was something I would let go or if I would, in the nicest 
 way possible, lay out the facts. I chose the latter. "Did you know 
 that ISS doesn't just provide one set of advice on how to vote?" 
 I asked. The advice provided depends on what the customer requests. No, 
 the board member hadn't known that. "That's interesting," the 
 director said.</p>
        <p>For ISS, it's similar to the old Burger King slogan, "Have it your 
 way," Pat McGurn, special counsel at ISS, told me in a wide-ranging 
 conversation last year. ISS has the standard burger -- but you can get 
 custom recommendations as well -- and many do. Gary Retelny, president 
 of ISS, explained in a letter to the SEC last week, "ISS implements 
 more than 400 custom voting policies on behalf of institutional investor 
 clients." And ISS is not alone in doing that. In an SEC roundtable 
 held in December, Katherine Rabin, CEO of another research firm, Glass 
 Lewis, said, "Eighty percent of our clients have custom policies."</p>
        <p>It's not one size fits all in another way as well. To the annoyance 
 of both corporations and shareholders alike, ISS' "house" recommendations 
 often don't take a hard and fast line. As an example, a proposal requiring 
 an independent chair, which to me is a no-brainer, is one ISS will not 
 support if certain other criteria are met.</p>
        <p>The power of ISS to sway votes has been "grossly overstated," 
 Michelle Lowry, professor of finance at Penn State, told me. "ISS 
 is not controlling the world." Her research related to mutual fund 
 voting shows that most mutual funds do not consistently vote with ISS' 
 house view, and even within a fund family, different funds may vote differently. 
 The way Vanguard does their voting mirrors the way many other large institutional 
 shareholder use ISS. Vanguard buys and finds useful ISS' non-customized 
 research along with data from a number of other providers as a set of 
 inputs to form their own voting opinions on each issue, says Glenn Booream, 
 head of proxy voting at Vanguard. Those decisions could differ from fund 
 to fund, he says, particularly in M&amp;A transactions, if one portfolio 
 holds the acquirer, one holds the target, and one holds both.</p>
        <p>"I don't know whether to be insulted [or to] feel patronized [by 
 the comments] that we just blindly follow the proxy advisory firms. We 
 don't," Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at CalSTRS, 
 said at the December SEC roundtable. The remarks by Karen Barr, general 
 counsel of the Investment Adviser Association, made clear that advisers 
 recognize that the responsibility for voting rests squarely with them 
 and not with the research firms that provide advice and information. Even 
 small firms know this, she said, and will not blindly follow what a research 
 provider might recommend.</p>

        <p>Mutual funds have had a reputation for being laggards in stepping up 
 to their voting responsibilities. When I was in the mutual fund business 
 in the 1980s and 1990s, it was common for all votes to go with management, 
 no matter what. Today, Lowrey's data show that less than 8% of mutual 
 funds do that. That's progress.</p>
        <p>Corporate boards have also made progress. Ten, even five years ago, 
 when I'd discuss the importance of studying the company's voting materials 
 and making sure they were accurate, some eyes would roll. Today, whether 
 they do a thorough job or not, few board members would say they are not 
 responsible for reviewing those documents. Like going to a movie so you 
 can discuss it with your friends, knowing that research firms are reading 
 the materials, that institutional investors are taking more care in their 
 reviews, and that the press is reporting on the issues provides impetus 
 for board members to take an interest.</p>
        <p>No doubt, the "one size fits all" meme for the research firms 
 will not die easily. A concerted educational campaign will be required. 
 Until an ISS buyer emerges, who will take up the task?</p>
