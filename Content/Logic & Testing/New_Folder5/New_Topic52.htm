 55%.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Shares of Tesla Motors soared to record levels early Thursday after 
 it reported much stronger than expected profits and forecast it will sell 
 55% more vehicles this year than last year.</p>
        <p>Tesla (TSLA) is expanding its customer base to Europe and China and 
 expects global sales to reach 35,000 vehicles for the full year.</p>
        <p>Tesla surges in Consumer Reports' best-liked ranking</p>
        <p>The surge in sales won't kick in right away though, as cars bound for 
 Asia and Europe will take longer to be delivered than cars bound for U.S. 
 buyers. In a conference call with analysts Wednesday afternoon, Tesla 
 CEO Elon Musk said there is "likely to be unmet demand in China this 
 year."</p>
        <p>The company reported that it earned $45.9 million in the quarter, nearly 
 three times higher than the previous quarter, while revenue jumped 26%.</p>
        <p>The company is still a tiny niche player compared to other traditional 
 automakers. It has only one model, the Model S, which starts at $69,000. 
 But it has grown rapidly in the past year thanks to rave reviews from 
 auto critics and strong customer loyalty. Consumer Reports has called 
 the Model S the best car it has ever reviewed and customers have made 
 it the best-liked car on the market.</p>

        <p>When will you be able to afford a Tesla?</p>
        <p>The company said Wednesday it is close to making production versions 
 of its next model, the Model X crossover hybrid, and that those highly 
 anticipated vehicles should be available for sale in about a year.</p>
        <p>Musk said that although Tesla has yet to do any marketing for the Model 
 X, demand for it is "very high."</p>
        <p>"It's like if you were going fishing and the fish were jumping 
 into the boat," he said. Musk added that Model X demand may exceed 
 demand for the existing Model S.</p>
        <p>"This is very speculative, so don't hold me to it, but that's my 
 best guess," he said.</p>
        <p>Tesla also reported Wednesday that it was no longer depending on the 
 sale of regulatory credits it received for selling zero-emission vehicles 
 for any of its revenue or profit.</p>
        <p>Some analysts had suggested the company was dependent on those credits 
 rather than profits from actual car sales and questioned what would happen 
 when they disappeared. This was Tesla's most profitable quarter and the 
 first time it was in the black without the help of the zero emission credits.
