        <p>Survey: Apple iPhone demand 4 million better than expected</p>

        <p>FORTUNE -- The vertical gap between the black triangle and the blue 
 square at the far right of the attached chart -- sent to clients Wednesday 
 by Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty -- may not look like much.</p>
        <p>But it represents 4 million iPhones, the difference between the Street's 
 estimate of iPhone shipments in the quarter that ends next week and Morgan 
 Stanley's estimate of iPhone demand.</p>
        <p>And because more than half of Apple's (AAPL) quarterly revenue derives 
 from iPhone sales, the gap probably represents the difference between 
 a ho-hum second fiscal quarter for Apple and a blowout.</p>
        <p>Why should we care what Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise Tracker says? See 
 Huberty's Exhibit 2:</p>
