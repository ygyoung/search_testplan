        <p>Microsoft stock up 4%, hits 14-year high</p>

        <p>Microsoft's 14-year roller coaster ride is over, as its stock reached 
 its highest level since March 2000.</p>
        <p>289</p>
        <p>TOTAL SHARES</p>

        <p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney)</p>
        <p>Microsoft has finally put the worst of the dot-com bust behind it. Shares 
 surged more than 4% Tuesday to their highest price since March 24, 2000.</p>
        <p>The stock rose after Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) disclosed plans for 
 a press conference about a new product for mobile and cloud computing 
 to take place on March 27. Microsoft is widely expected to unveil Office 
 for the iPad -- a release that many analysts believe is long overdue. 
 New CEO Satya Nadella will be making the announcement.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's stock has mostly oscillated between $20 and $40 over the 
 past decade and a half, a frustrating period for investors who called 
 on the company to innovate beyond software for the PC.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="search" />Under CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft largely missed the boat on major 
 tech trends of the past decade, including smartphones, tablets, search 
 and portable music. Meanwhile, Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) and Apple (AAPL, 
 Fortune 500) both surpassed the company in market value.</p>
        <p>Related: Microsoft launches cheaper Office 365 'Personal'</p>
        <p>Shares have been on a tear since August, when Ballmer announced his 
 retirement. Longtime Microsoft executive Nadella took over for Ballmer 
 last month.</p>
        <p>Microsoft CEO: &#160;</p>
        <p>Microsoft CEO: "Mobile first, cloud first"</p>
        <p>Microsoft has performed well as it transitions into a devices and services 
 company. Microsoft has found success with its Xbox One video game console 
 and Kinect attachment. Sales of its Surface tablet and Windows Phone devices 
 are growing -- albeit from a very small base.</p>
        <p>The company also announced plans last year to buy the smartphone business 
 of Nokia (NOK), further solidifying its new role as a hardware maker.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's software for businesses has also been a major driver of 
 its recent success. Nadella had led Microsoft's corporate software unit 
 before being named as CEO. &#160;To top of page</p>
