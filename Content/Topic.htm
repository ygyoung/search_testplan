        <p>(CNN) -- Big, big sigh of relief among Russia's super-rich, as the West 
 announces "smart sanctions" against a group of Kremlin officials 
 and members of Russian parliament in response to the referendum that took 
 place in Crimea and produced a result resembling the elections in the 
 old Soviet Union: 96.7% of the people who took part in it voted for the 
 peninsula to become part of Russia.</p>
        <p>The joke on the streets of Moscow is that the politicians took the bullet 
 for the oligarchs, not for the first time and not the last.</p>
        <p>But jokes aside, the fate of Crimea is sealed. It will become part of 
 Russia in about three months' time and, as things stand now, President 
 Vladimir Putin has already signed an executive order recognizing the peninsula 
 as an independent state, confirming his determination to stick to his 
 guns in his address to the Federal Assembly.</p>
